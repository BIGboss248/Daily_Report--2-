Turkish deepsea import scrap prices
edge up as offers remain scarce
 Sources report lack of offers amid the holiday season
 Turkish mills report being short on material
Turkish import deepsea scrap prices continued to rise slightly
Dec. 28, as Turkish mills reported limited scrap availability amid
the holiday season.
Platts assessed Turkish imports of premium heavy melting
scrap 1/2 (80:20) at $390/mt CFR Dec. 28, up $3.25/mt on the day.
General sentiment appeared to indicate a likely increase
in scrap prices as the year draws to a close, with a collection
slowdown, holiday season and increased demand from Turkish
mills cited as potential catalysts.
“There are limited offers now. Sellers are waiting due to a
lack of supply and the holiday season, but the mills haven’t met
their needs yet,” a Turkish mill source said, “they [the mills] will
probably start to show interest in purchasing scrap again.”
“I am not surprised at the upside [in scrap prices],” a trader
said, before confirming the completion of a Venezuela-origin
cargo booked Dec. 22 by an Iskenderun mill as a top-up to a
Iron ore market
Asian iron ore prices to increase
on firm seaborne liquidity
 Seaborne iron ore buying interests increase
 Portside liquidity high
Seaborne iron ore market stayed firm as spot liquidity continued
to improve.
Platts assessed the 62% Fe Iron Ore Index at $114.75/dry mt
CFR North China on Dec. 28, up 10 cents/dmt from Dec. 27.
Market participants were optimistic about the steel demand
after China’s Lunar New Year, as demand in China’s property
market is likely to pick up as part of a larger reopening of the
country and subsequent economic revival, according to market
sources.
Stronger expectations on iron ore restock demand was
observed as sources pointed out that most mills in China were
running iron ore stock at a low level.
“It is time for Chinese steel mills to build up stock levels now,”
an international trader source based in Hong Kong said.

With nearly all the medium-grade mainstream fines seeing
some improvement in prices on floating basis, the buying
interests in Australian Pilbara Blend fines, or PBF, were likely to
be the strongest.
Rio Tinto concluded three 170,000 mt of Pilbara Blend fines
(PBF) cargoes during Dec. 27 night session to Dec. 28 in fixed
price on the trading platforms. The three fixed price trades
were equivalent to a premium of $2.05-$2.25/dmt over February
average of IODEX. The premium level jumped by around $1/dmt
as compared with the same PBF cargo sold by a miner about one
week ago.
Market participants attributed the fast uptick of PBF prices
to the liquidity advantage in the brand as compared to the
other medium-grade cargoes. Sources considered PBF as the
prioritized choice on restock purpose, as PBF would be easier to
offload on either seaborne or portside market in the coming first
quarter.
“PBF has greater liquidity [so] traders prefer that and pay a
premium,” an international trader source said.
Platts assessed an additional brand premium of PBF at
30 cents/dmt on Dec. 28.
At China portside, the trading activities in Tangshan and
Shandong regions were active on Dec 28. More mills were
tendering iron ore for restocking before New Year’s Day holiday.
As most mills’ steel production margins remained low, trading
activities for medium- and low-grade fines were much better than
high-grade fines.
Platts assessed 62% Fe IOPEX North China at Yuan 856/wmt
FOT Dec. 28, down Yuan 4/mt from Dec. 27, or at $114.74/dmt on
an import-parity basis. info@GigaPaper.ir
Platts assessed 62% Fe IOPEX East China at Yuan 845/wmt
FOT Dec. 28, down Yuan 2/mt during the same period, or at
$113.35/dmt on an import-parity basis.
Seaborne lump premiums fell further in the day as several
participants continue to voice out similar views with regards to
lump’s weak demand. Moreover, alongside BHP selling a Newman
Blend Lump (NBL) cargo at a premium of 10.8 cents/dmtu over
the February average of the IODEX, via bilateral negotiations, a
tender put out by a Japanese steel mill for a 210,000 mt cargo
of NBL — with loading laycan Jan. 20-29 — was heard to have
concluded at around $116.5/dmt in the day, according to sources.
Platts assessed the spot lump premium at 9.8 cents/dmtu on
Dec. 28, down 0.7 cent/dmtu from Dec. 27.

Asian pellet premiums gradually decline as muted
trading activity persists
 No major changes in fundamentals over the week
 Market awaiting clear direction on pellet prices
Buyers’ uncertainty amid rising COVID-19 cases along with muted
trading activity due to year-end holidays marginally weighed on
pellet premiums in the week to Dec. 28.
Platts assessed the spot blast furnace pellet premium over
the 62% Fe iron ore index at $16.65/dry mt CFR North China
Dec. 28, down 40 cents/dmt from Dec. 21, after adjusting on a
65% Fe basis.
Platts assessed 63% Fe blast furnace pellet at $122.35/dmt
CFR North China Dec. 28, down $2.10/dmt from Dec. 27 and down
40 cents/dmt from Dec. 21. The premium was assessed at
$8.05/dmt CFR North China, down $1.05/dmt and $1.25/dmt
from Dec. 27 and Dec. 21, respectively.
Demand for pellet has not yet improved despite efforts by
China to open up the economy by relaxing pandemic-related
relaxations, market participants said.
Several participants are away because of year-end holidays,
resulting in muted activity, traders said.
Over the week, fundamentals have not changed significantly
in the pellet market, traders said, while expecting a similar
situation to persist for couple of weeks going ahead.
An eastern India-based trader said interest seen from
buyers in China immediately after the government removed
duty on exports of pellets in November has gradually
evaporated.
Buyers in China have “halted” buying pellet in the seaborne
market and have adopted a “cautious stance” currently, the
trader said.
Rising cases in China have weighed on trading, with an
already fragile demand for pellet taking a further hit.
Several traders said uncertainty about the market direction is
a deterrent for buyers from booking large volumes.
A Singapore-based trader added that buyers in China are
showing absolutely no interest in pellets and lumps at the
moment. Weak margins continue to restrict a sharp uptick in
interest from mills in China for premium-quality raw materials.
A southern India-based producer said China-based buyers
are still interested in buying according to their immediate
requirements and that it may take more time for sharp rebound
in demand.
After the Lunar New Year concludes in January 2023, a clear
direction for prices may emerge as buyers would return to the
market in full swing, a few traders said.
Prices in the domestic market are neither increasing nor
declining, participants said, adding that firm demand from local
consumers has cushioned a deep fall in prices.
Further, an eastern India-based producer said stability in the
market is desirable as it may result in propping up confidence of
buyers and help in concluding deals.
With increasing coking coal prices and China gradually
opening up, demand for pellet may improve in coming days, a few
traders said.
The improvement in consumption of steel and subsequent
recovery in mills’ margins in China can whet appetite for pellets,
sources said.

Coking coal market
Asia met coal PLV trades rangebound as market
awaits greater clarity on price direction
 Bid heard at $285/mt for Feb-loading globalCOAL HCCLV
Peak Down
 Domestic Chinese prices rangebound amid rise in
logistical delays
Asia met coal PLV FOB prices were steady as market participants
hung on the sidelines to make more sense of the price directions
before making procurement strategy Dec. 28.
Platts assessed Premium Low Vol flat at $285.75/mt FOB
Australia while the delivered price to China was stable at $315/mt
CFR China Dec. 28.
The FOB Australia market observed a bid at $285/mt FOB
Australia for 35,000 mt of globalCOAL HCCLV Peak Downs, with
a Feb. 11-20, 2023, loading laycan. No deal was concluded as of
5:30 pm Singapore time.
“Market participants remain on the sidelines for greater clarity
on price direction in the current market, especially as talks on
China-Australia possibly easing trade barriers toned down with
no official announcement heard, causing some quietness in the
market,” an international trader said.
Another end-user mentioned that the possibility of wet
weather conditions in Australia worsening in the coming months
was still weighing on the market, hence said it would suggest
the price levels for an end-January/early-February cargo remain
reasonable currently.
“Indian steel mills are still observing pockets of demand for
cargo as per routine restocking demand, hence providing support
for the current coking coal prices,” an Indian trader said.
However, split views continued to be heard in the market.
An Indian end-user said fundamentally, the market still
remains at the $250-$260/mt FOB Australia levels, with no
significant reason that warrants a $20-$30/mt uptick in coking
coal prices. Many end-users will not be able to procure at current
coking coal prices, the end-user added.
Another Southeast Asian end-user said even if it was looking
to procure for production needs, the current coking coal prices
were deterring it from making any purchasing decision.
Prices were rangebound in the domestic China market amid
COVID-19 related logistical delays affecting the transportation of
coals to the portside and to steel mills.
Platts assessed the domestic Shanxi PLV price flat at Yuan
2,600/mt ex-washplant on the week to Dec. 28, while the CFR
China equivalent of Shanxi PLV was at $347.36/mt, up 46 cents/mt
from the week before. The domestic-seaborne price spread stood
at $32.36/mt Dec. 28, with the imported one being cheaper.
“Domestic prices for PLV quality coals are well-sustained,
especially with the rise in COVID-19 cases in China causing varying
extents of logistical delays in getting coals to the buyers from the
mine sites, thus providing support at current prices,” a Chinabased trader said.
In the CFR China market, prices were steady as participants
remained on the sidelines for seaborne imported coal with a
far arrival laycan, unclear on the market outlook once the cargo
arrives after the Lunar New Year.
Tradable values were heard at $300-$320/mt CFR China for
US Premium Low Vol Blue Creek No. 7.
Buy-sell price expectations remained wide in the international
domestic met coke markets.
Indian traders showed offer prices for domestic coke at
Rupees 42,000-45,000/mt ($506.59/mt).
“The domestic met coke offers have increased in line with
met coal prices but there is no buying interest at these levels,” an
India-based trader said.
A tradable value for India domestic CSR 65 met coke was
indicated at Rupees 37,000-38,000/mt ex-works basis.

Scrap market
Japanese H2 ferrous scrap price falls on week
 South Korea’s Hyundai buys spot cargoes
 Deepsea market held stable amid muted trading
Platts assessed the weekly spot H2 ferrous scrap FOB Japan
price down Yen 1,000/mt on the week at Yen 49,300/mt ($368/mt)
Dec. 28.
South Korea’s Hyundai possibly bought 23,000 mt of H2 at Yen
49,000/mt on Dec. 27 for February shipment. The price was Yen
1,000/mt lower than its last tender a week earlier.
“Many suppliers are going to follow Hyundai’s prices,” said a
South Korea-based trading source. No deals for H2 were heard
concluded this week. “Mills are definitely trying to pay lower than
Yen 49,000/mt,” said another South Korean trading source.
Tokyo Steel last increased its scrap bidding prices on Dec. 14,
with H2 grade at Utsunomiya at Yen 49,000/mt. FAS prices for
H2 in Japan in the week ended Dec. 28 held stable around Yen
48,500-50,000/mt.
Offers for Japanese H1/H2 50:50 scrap on a CFR Taiwan basis
were heard around $400-$405/mt, with buyers targeting below
$400/mt. Deals were done in the previous week around $390-
$395/mt. “I did not receive any offers from suppliers this week,”
said a Taiwan-based mill source.
Offers for Japanese H2 on a CFR Vietnam basis were heard
around $405-$410/mt, edging down from last week’s offers
around $408-$414/mt. No bids and no deals were heard.
East Asia deepsea market stable
The East Asia deepsea market held stable amid muted spot
trading during the year-end holiday season.
Platts assessed the weekly spot CFR East Asia HMS 1/2 80:20
price stable at $400/mt for the week ended Dec. 28, with South

Korea as the basis port.
“There were no inquiries for deepsea cargoes, and no offers
from suppliers were received, as scrap demand was being
fulfilled by regional shortsea cargoes from Japan,” a South Koreabased trading source said. Hyundai possibly bought this week in
total 69,000 mt of four different grades of scrap, including HS, H2,
H1/H2 50:50 and Shredded on a FOB Japan basis for February
shipment. Its last tender concluded in the previous week saw the
major South Korean steel maker buying around 97,000 mt in total
for Jan. 20 shipment at the latest.
Domestic prices rose by Won 20,000/mt this week with Heavy
A prices at around Won 520,000-525,000/mt ($410-$414/mt) and
Light A at Won 490,000-505,000/mt.
Indicative offers for USWC-origin deepsea cargoes were
heard around $415-$420/mt CFR Vietnam basis, largely stable
against offers in the previous week around $410-$420/mt. No
bids or deals were heard this week. “Market is quiet and domestic
demand is rather weak at the moment, and domestic prices are
unchanged this week, reflective of the sluggish demand,” said a
Vietnam-based trading source.

Brazilian local ferrous scrap market
pauses as exports take spotlight
 Domestic market prices stable
 Restocking, exporting seen as alternatives
Brazilian ferrous scrap market participants have opted for
restocking instead of booking sales at lower prices amid
weak demand.
As an alternative, significant tonnages have been allocated for
exports.
For most market participants, the domestic market was
in a pause, but with stable prices after they plunged for over
two months.
One of the strategies adopted by a dealer was stocking
material while prices remain low, while he expects to get better
selling prices in the short term.
He said the CSN mill “has already announced a 10%
readjustment on its steel products for January, and China has
been more flexible.”
A scrap seller active in the automotive market said after price
reductions he was seeing some stability, and the automotive
market “is predicting the same stability for the next year, maybe a
little growth.”
He was betting on his competitiveness: “But ours [prices] were
maintained, I believe because of the volume, quality and proximity
to their location [scrap dealers].”
Although he sees the domestic market receiving some
material, a dealer who has been exporting to India and
Bangladesh is focused on exports “as we managed to add
more value.”
According to S&P Global Commodity Insights’ Commodities at
Sea platform, India has imported about 1.13 million mt of ferrous
scrap in 31 bulk cargoes since Aug. 1. Also, containerized import
shredded scrap prices are dropping as “mills are not buying
at the moment as they have sufficient material in pipeline,” an
Indian mill source said. “They should be in the market sometime
in mid-January.”
Platts assessed the weekly Brazilian clean steel scrap price
static through Dec. 27 at Real 1,250/mt FOT, based on a range of
Real 1,200-1,300/mt of most repeatable deals, offers and bids,
with HMS ½ grade unchanged at Real 950/mt FOT and turnings
scrap steady at Real 700/mt FOT (a range of Real 600-800/mt).
For a non-ferrous producer, “There is a lot of used-beverage
can nowadays, and not many people buying it.”
Platts assessed aluminum profile and aluminum casting
unchanged at Real 13/kg and Real 10/kg, respectively, on an FOT
basis. Aluminum used-beverage cans, or UBCs, dropped 3.8% to
Real 7.55/kg based on range of Real 7.40-7.70/kg.

Ferroalloys market
Chinese ferrochrome import prices
continue to gain in a stronger market
 Chinese domestic offers higher at Yuan 8,800/mt
 UG2 chrome ore prices stable
 Japanese ferrochrome prices rise
Chinese ferrochrome offers increased by Yuan 200/mt on
the week to Yuan 8,800/mt (about 100 cents/lb) Dec. 28, with
tradable values slightly lower.
Indicative bids were heard at 97-98 cents/lb for imported
material, while sellers’ indications were pegged in the
100-101 cents/lb range.
Platts assessed Chinese ferrochrome import price in the 97-
100 cents/lb CIF China range Dec. 28, up 2 cents/lb.
“Despite the rise in COVID-19 cases in China, it seems like its a
step in the right direction from China, allowing for some optimism
in the market,” an international trader said, referring to easing
movement curbs in China.
Minor disruptions in production and end-users restocking
before the festive season are supporting the complex, the
source said.
Market sources said the price guidance set by Chinese
companies for January was up Yuan 500, signaling a stronger
sentiment in the market.
A stronger China complex also lifted Indian domestic offers to
Rupee 99,000-Rupee 101,000/mt ex-plant basis Dec. 28, equating
to 98-99 cents CIF basis.
Traders said Indian prices have started lagging Chinese
domestic prices as buoyant sentiments in China reverse the

market’s prior discount. Sources expect China prices to remain
elevated in the near term.
UG2 chrome ore prices were heard stable on the week at
$255-$260/mt.
Charge chrome was heard trading at a 1-cent premium to
high-carbon ferrochrome.
Platts assessed CIF Japan ferrochrome higher at 103-
105 cents/lb Dec. 28, with multiple Japanese market sources
attributing the increase to a rise in global prices.
Japanese traders expect prices to stay elevated within the
range for spot deals, with larger contracts lower around a tender
closed at 99 cents/lb in the week ended Dec. 23.

Asian ferrosilicon, silicomanganese prices
rangebound amid year-end holidays
 Spot deal for Malaysian 75% FeSi booked at $1,630/mt
CIF Japan
 Indian 65% SiMn heard traded at $1,020/mt CIF Japan
Platts assessed Chinese 75% Si ferrosilicon at $1,600-$1,620/mt
FOB China on Dec. 28, unchanged from Dec. 21, with the Japanese
import price also assessed flat, at $1,620-$1,640/mt CIF Japan.
The 65% Silicomanganese CIF Japan price was assessed at
$1,020-$1,040/mt, narrowing equally on both the low and high
ends on the week.
Offers for 75% ferrosilicon were indicated at $1,640-$1,680/mt
CIF Japan for January/February loadings, while offers for 65%
silicomanganese were seen ranging $1,030-$1,060/mt CIF Japan for
the same period, according to market participants.
A spot deal was reported concluded Dec. 23 for 200 mt of
Malaysian 75% ferrosilicon for January shipment at $1,630/mt
CIF Japan.
For 65% silicomanganese, a spot deal for 500 mt of Indian
material was reported concluded Dec. 27 for January shipment
at $1,020/mt CIF Japan, and another deal for 50 mt of Malaysian
material was reported concluded Dec. 23 for January shipment at
$1,030/mt CIF Japan.
“With China reopening and easing COVID-19 measures
drastically, it should support the downstream steel market next
year,” a producer said, but noted that the immediate impact on
physical markets has been relatively muted thus far as compared
to futures.
A Japanese trader agreed that steel demand recovery would
begin next year. “All customers already purchased JanuaryMarch cargoes and [were] preparing next [for the] Q2 purchase. I
think the next big purchase will start from mid- or end-January,”
they added.
“Generally, it’s not so active now due to the ongoing year-end
holidays and the Lunar New Year festivities coming up, but there
seems to be some upward pressure from the Chinese market,” an
Asian consumer said in reference to Chinese ferrosilicon prices.
The higher end of offer prices for 75% ferrosilicon were of
Chinese origin, while offers from Asia ex-China origins held at the
lower end of the spectrum.
Another Japanese trader said that upstream manganese ore
prices could be supporting 65% silicomanganese offers. The
Platts Manganese Ore 44% Mn CIF China assessment stood at
$4.90/dmtu as of Dec. 23, up from $4.60/dmtu a month ago on
the back of restocking ahead of the Lunar New Year.

Turkish rebar strengthens as
domestic scrap prices rise
 Mills’ domestic scrap purchase prices increase
 Mills’ domestic rebar list prices rise by $10-$20/mt
Major Turkish steel makers have raised their domestic rebar list
prices by $10-$20/mt in recent days due to some restocking
activity and the rise seen in domestic scrap prices, amid strong
imported scrap pricing.
According to integrated long steelmaker Kardemir’s latest
price list seen by S&P Global, it was offering 12-32 mm rebar
at Lira 12,350 mt ($660/mt) ex-works as of Dec. 27, up $10/mt
on week.
Other Turkish mills have generally begun offering rebar to
the domestic market at $670-$680/mt EXW in recent days,
depending on tonnage and region, also around $10-$20/mt higher
week on week, according to company price lists.
Platts, part of S&P Global Commodity Insights, last assessed
Turkish exported rebar at $659/mt FOB Dec. 23, stable on the
day, while the assessment for Turkish imports of premium heavy
melting scrap 1/2 (80:20) was at $386.75/mt CFR.
Some major Turkish steel mills have also increased their
domestic scrap purchase prices in recent days, amid strong
imported scrap pricing.
According to company price lists seen by S&P Global, major
Turkish steelmaker Colakoglu raised its DKP grade (auto bundle)
scrap purchase on Dec. 27 by Lira 150/mt to Lira 7,380/mt
($393/mt) and extra grade domestic scrap purchase price by the
same amount to Lira 6,855/mt.
The DKP grade scrap buying price for Asil Celik also rose by
the same amount on Dec. 27 to Lira 7,430/mt, while its extra
grade domestic scrap buying price increased to Lira 6,850/mt.
Long steelmaker Kroman Celik’s DKP grade scrap purchase
price rose to Lira 7,250/mt and extra grade domestic scrap price
increased to 6,840/mt Dec. 27.
Turkey’s largest integrated steelmaker, Eregli Demir Celik
raised its buying price for DKP grade scrap for its Iskenderun
plant in southern Turkey (Isdemir) by Lira 150/mt to Lira 7,280/mt
and extra grade scrap buying price to Lira 7,275/mt Dec. 27.

The group’s Eregli mill in northern Turkey (Erdemir) also pulled
up its domestic scrap purchase price for DKP grade scrap by the
same amount to Lira 7,530/mt and extra grade to Lira 7,525/mt as
of Dec. 27.
Turkish mills consume around 30 million mt/year of
scrap, typically procuring about a quarter of it from the
domestic market.

China’s met coal stocks post sharp dip,
but price hike limited: sources
 Coking coal stocks fall 22% on year
 Market anticipating improved China-Australia trade ties
China’s metallurgical coal stocks fell sharply from a year ago
after some mines reduced or halted production, which led to a
squeeze in supply, industry sources said Dec. 28.
As of Dec. 22, coking coal stocks in China stood at
22.73 million mt, down 22% year on year, latest data from
investment bank CIFCO Founder showed Dec. 28.
However, despite tighter supply, a near-term price uptrend
is expected to be limited due to an improvement in the sector’s
profits, analysts said.
Also, a huge volume of Mongolian coal stocks at the ChinaMongolia land border ports’ warehouses and subdued spot steel
product prices were expected to cap met coal prices.
Currently, an estimated 2.5 million mt of Mongolian coal
inventories are stocked up at supervised warehouses at land
border ports, according to Zhongzhou Futures.
Focus on Australia-China trade ties
Meanwhile, market players have been anticipating s
resumption in China’s import of met coal from Australia after
Chinese officials met with Australia’s foreign minister recently,
analysts said.
China’s strategic partnership with Australia would foster
economic development in Asia-Pacific and the world, which
raises expectations of China resuming Australian coal imports,
securities firm Shanxi Securities Company said.
However, even if China resumes Australian imports, met coal
trade between the two countries would be limited as Australian
coal prices remain high, while China found alternative sources
of coal.
China placed an “unofficial” ban on Australian coal since 2020,
cutting the country’s access to the largest importing market
in Asia. Before 2020, China used to buy most of the coal from
Australia.
Iron ore
Iron ore stocks at key Chinese ports as of Dec. 23 reached
133.99 million mt, down 15% on the year, but slightly higher on the
week, data from East Asia Futures, the research arm of Bank of
East Asia, showed.
During the week ended Dec. 23, iron ore stocks for trade were
reported at 80.73 million mt, down 13% on the year, the EAF
data showed.
Inventories at China’s key end-users, namely steel plants,
reached 92.39 million mt as of Dec. 23, down 13% on the year.

Inventories remained low, with prevailing stocks enough to last 34
days, down from around 41 days during the same period of 2021.
China’s energy savings and emission reduction goals were
expected to keep the steel sector’s profits under pressure, which
could push China to use more scrap, analysts with investment
bank Goldtrust Futures said.
This could reduce Chinese steel sector’s iron ore usage by
around 28 million-30 million mt in 2023 from current levels.
According to the EAF, the volume of iron ore that arrived at
Chinese ports reached 24.08 million mt as of Dec. 23, up 11% on
the year, and 4% higher on the week.

India identifies four new coking
coal blocks to boost output
 New blocks likely to be auctioned to private players
 FY 2021-22 coking coal production to rise 13.37% on year
 India targets 140 mil mt coking coal output by 2030
India identified four new coking coal blocks to spruce up
domestic output and trim imports, a statement by the federal
coal ministry said Dec. 28.
“…Central Mine Planning and Design Institute (CMPDI) also
will finalize Geological Report (GR) for four to six new coking
coal blocks in the coming months. These blocks may be offered
in subsequent rounds of auction for private sector to further
increase domestic raw coking coal supply,” the statement said.
The nation’s shortage of coking coal has become Indian
steelmakers’ “biggest pain point,” Commerce Minister Piyush
Goyal said at an industry event in Delhi in November, Platts, part
of S&P Global Commodity Insights, reported earlier.
New Delhi targets coking coal production to touch
140 million mt by 2030.
However, market participants expressed ambivalence at
the target.
“The target is achievable if there were higher annual growth
rates. Even if there is a double-digit growth rate this year, it is
highly unlikely to persist next year,” an India-based trader dealing
in met coal said.
Demand fundamentals
The effort comes at a time when India’s appetite for coking
coal has been on the rise amid domestic steel capacity
expansions. Over the past year, India has overtaken China to be
the world’s top importer of coking coal.
India imports a large proportion of its coking coal
requirements from major producers such as Australia. As per
data from the coal ministry, India imported 57.16 million mt of
coking coal in the 2021-22 financial year. India’s financial year runs
from April-March.
The statement also added that state-run Coal India has
identified nine new mines with a Peak Rate Capacity or, PRC, of
22 million mt by 2025. PRC shows a mine’s maximum annual
output after a few years of operations.
CIL has also offered eight discontinued coking coal mines with
a PRC of 2 million mt to private investors on a revenue-sharing
model basis.
Coal India’s November output touched 60.70 million mt this
year against 53.80 million mt during the corresponding month
of 2021, according to data from the company’s website. The
production between April to November this year rose 16.8% on
the year to 412.60 million mt.
According to provisional data from the Coal ministry, India’s
coking coal production during the financial year 2021-22 is
expected to rise 13.37% year on year to 51.70 million mt.

Freight
Pacific Capesize freight rates
drop lower despite reasonable demand
 Tonnage exceeds cargoes in the Pacific
 Operators nominate own ships to cargoes due to lack of arb
opportunities
Capesize freight rates in the Pacific edged lower on Dec. 28
despite reasonable activity, as tonnage supply exceeded demand,
market sources said.
“Overall, the market is not dead, but rather dull,” a shipowner
source said, adding that lack of activity out of the Atlantic basin
and thin liquidity in the freight derivative markets were not
helping the sentiment in the market.
In the Pacific, Rio Tinto was heard to have fixed a Capesize
ship at $8/wmt for moving iron ore from Port Dampier in Western
Australia to Qingdao in China for Jan. 12 loading onward. Bao
Island was also heard to have fixed a ship at low $8s/wmt to
move iron ore from Western Australia to Qingdao for Jan. 12-
15 laycan.
BHP was also heard seeking a Capesize ship from Port
Hedland in Western Australia to Qingdao for Jan. 12-14 laycan.
“Quite a few cargoes that are there out of Australia. But, the
list of ships is even longer,” the shipowner source said.
A ship chartering source with a miner said that the Pacific
market was finding a floor at current levels.
“Early ships are not abundant,” the ship charter source said.
“Perhaps there is some discount there for forward dates but not
for prompt loading dates.”
Platts assessed the freight rate for a Capesize ship to move
170,000 mt (plus/minus 10%) of iron ore from Port Hedland to
Qingdao at $8.05/wmt Dec. 28, down 25 cents/wmt from Dec. 27.
Activity was thin in the Atlantic basin.
Multiple market sources said that shipowners were mostly
keen to trade their ships within the Pacific rather than ballast
toward Brazil. “One would ballast out only if they cannot find
suitable cargo,” the shipowner said. “Demand out of Brazil for
www.GigaPaper.irSBB Steel Markets Daily December 28, 2022

end-January and early February is still a question mark.”
The ship chartering source pointed out that inquiries from
ship operators for loading cargoes out of west Africa and Brazil
for early and mid-January dates seemed to have “disappeared,”
as they are perhaps being performed on their own ships due to
the lack of arbitrage opportunities.
On Dec. 28, Anglo American was heard with a 165,000-
180,000 mt iron ore cargo from Acu in Brazil to Bahrain for
Jan. 27-Feb. 2 laycan.
Indicative offers for ships arriving at Brazil around Jan. 22-23
were heard at $20/wmt for a trip from Tubarao to Qingdao.
Platts assessed the freight rate for a Capesize ship to move
170,000 mt (plus/minus 10%) of iron ore from Tubarao in Brazil to
Qingdao at $19.15/wmt Dec. 28, unchanged from Dec. 27.
Out of South Africa, fresh exchanges were not heard.
Platts assessed the freight rate for a Capesize ship to move
170,000 mt (plus/minus 10%) of iron ore from Saldanha Bay in
South Africa to Qingdao at $14.10/wmt Dec. 28, flat on the day.

Assessment Rationales
Platts Asia Iron Ore IODEX Daily Rationale & Exclusions
Platts assessed the 62% Fe Iron Ore Index at $114.75/dry mt CFR
North China on Dec. 28, up 10 cents/dmt from Dec. 27, in line with
a Pilbara Blend Fines (PBF) trade.
At 5:09 pm Singapore time, Rio Tinto sold a 170,000-mt cargo
of PBF at $114.45/dmt basis 62% Fe CFR China, on globalORE,
with Jan. 28–Feb. 6 loading laycan, from Dampier to Qingdao.
Taking into account the impurity adjustments, timing and the
additional brand spread for PBF of minus 30 cents/dmt, the PBF
trade normalized to $114.75/dmt on IODEX specifications.
Platts used a backwardated structure of 75 cents/dmt
between January and February.
Platts is part of S&P Global Commodity Insights.
No market data was excluded from the assessment process
on Dec. 28.
The above rationale applies to Platts 62% FE IODEX & TSI
Iron Ore Fines 62% CFR China with the associated data code:
IODBZ00, TS01021
Platts China Iron Ore Lump Premium Daily Rationale &
Exclusions
Platts assessed the spot lump premium at 9.8 cents/dmtu on
Dec. 28, down 0.7 cent/dmtu from Dec. 27, in line with a Newman
Blend Lump (NBL) trade.
At 3:54 pm Singapore time, BHP sold an 80,000 mt cargo of
NBL at a premium of 10.8 cents/dmtu over the February average
of the IODEX basis 62.7% Fe CFR China, priced minus C5 on an
FOB basis, via bilateral negotiations, with a loadport laycan of
Jan. 26-Feb. 4.
The NBL trade normalized to a premium of 9.82 cents/dmtu
over the Platts’ two- to eight-week delivery window on a CFR
China basis.
Platts used a contango structure of 0.5 cents/dmtu between
January and February as the physical lump premium structure
across the two- to eight-week window.

Exclusions: No market data was excluded from the
assessment process on Dec. 28.
The above rationale applies to market data code: IOCLP00
Platts CFR North China Iron Ore 65% Fe low Al
Assessment Rationale
Platts assessed the 65% Fe North China Index at $127.4/dry mt
CFR North China on Dec. 28, up 10 cents/dmt from Dec. 27, in line
with tradable values, maintaining the spread between the 65%
and 62% Fe iron ore indexes at $12.65/dmt.
Industry sources said the tradeable spread between 65% Fe
North China Index and 62% Fe IODEX was around $11.5-$14.5/dmt.
Turkish deepsea import scrap prices
edge up as offers remain scarce ...from page 1
previously booked cargo, with 12,000-13,000 mt of HMS 1/2 (80:20)
at $392/mt CFR.
Buyside sources had considered the cargo quality to be higher
than HMS 1/2 (80:20).
A second reported deal was heard to be booked for HMS from
an unknown origin at around $390/mt CFR by an Iskenderun mill,
but the deal was denied by the buyside on the day.
However, the trader noted that any upside in Turkish
import scrap prices would be limited if rebar prices didn’t
increase too.
Platts assessed Turkish export rebar at $665/mt FOB Turkey
on Dec. 28, up $6/mt on the day.
Platts also heard strengthened domestic deal activity in the
Turkish rebar market, which prompted Turkish mills to increase
their export offers Dec. 28.
Marmara mill offers were heard at $685-$690/mt FOB, while
an Iskenderun mill offer was heard at $680/mt FOB. Indicative
tradable values for Turkish steel rebar ranged from $660-$675/mt
FOB Dec. 28.
The daily outright spread between Turkish export rebar
and import scrap was assessed at $275/mt Dec. 22, up
$2.75/mt on day, recovering slightly from Dec. 22’s four month low
at $272.25/mt.

This assessment rationale applies to the following market
data codes: 65% Fe CFR North China IOPRM00
Platts Hard Coking Coal Premium Low Vol CFR China
Daily Rationale
Platts assessed premium low-vol HCC flat at $315/mt CFR China
Dec. 28, in line with tradeable levels heard for the day.
Tradable levels were heard between $300-$320/mt CFR China
for US low vol Blue Creek 7, which was normalized for its $2/mt
quality discount to Platts PLV CFR China at $302-$322/mt.
Exclusions: No market data was excluded from the
assessment process.
Platts is part of S&P Global Commodity Insights.
The above rationale applies to Platts premium low vol CFR
China assessment (PLVHC00) & TSI Prem JM25 CFR Jingtang
(TS01044).
Platts Hard Coking Coal Premium Low Vol FOB Australia
Daily Rationale
Platts assessed premium low-vol HCC flat at $285.75/mt FOB
Australia Dec. 28, above a bid and in line with tradable levels
heard for the day.
A bid was heard at $285/mt FOB Australia for 35,000 mt of
globalCOAL HCCLV Peak Downs with a Feb. 11-20 loading laycan.
This was for a coal normalized at parity to Platts PLV FOB
Australia at $285/mt.
Tradeable values were heard between $270-$300/mt for
Australia premium mid vol Goonyella, normalized downward
by 25 cents/mt to account for its premium to Platts PLV FOB
Australia at $269.75-$299.75/mt FOB Australia. Platts assessed
the January-February spread at minus $4/mt, unchanged from
the previous day.
Exclusions: No market data was excluded from the
assessment process.
Platts is part of S&P Global Commodity Insights.
The above rationale applies to Platts Premium Low Vol FOB
Australia assessment (PLVHA00) & TSI Premium Hard Coking Coal
Australia Export FOB East Coast Port (TS01034).
Platts EMEA Turkish Ferrous Scrap Daily Rationale
Platts assessed Turkish imports of premium heavy melting scrap
1/2 (80:20) at $390/mt CFR Dec. 28, up $3.25/mt on the day.
A sell-side source said a Venezuela-origin cargo was booked
Dec. 22 by an Iskenderun mill as a top-up to a previously booked
cargo, with 12,000-13,000 mt of HMS 1/2 (80:20) at $392/mt CFR.
Buy-side sources considered the cargo quality to be higher than
HMS 1/2 (80:20).
A second reported deal was heard booked for HMS from an
unknown origin at around $390/mt CFR by an Iskenderun mill,
but the deal was denied by the buy-side on the day.
An agent source reported offers for US/Baltic-origin HMS
1/2 (80:20) at above $390/mt CFR, and also cited an indicative
tradable value at around $390/mt CFR, due to a lack of supply in
the current holiday season.
A second agent source shared an indicative tradable value for
US/Baltic HMS 1/2 (80:20) at above $390/mt CFR.
A Turkish mill source also reported offers for premium HMS 1/2
(80:20) at above $390/mt CFR, and shared an indicative tradable
value for premium HMS at below $390/mt CFR.
A second Turkish mill source shared an indicative tradable
value for US/Baltic HMS 1/2 (80:20) at $400/mt CFR, though this
was not repeated by other market sources.
Exclusions: No data was excluded from the assessment.
Platts is part of S&P Global Commodity Insights.
The above rationale applies to Platts-TSI assessment of
Turkish premium deep sea HMS 1/2 (80:20) imports, with the
associated market data code TS01011
US Shredded Scrap Midwest Daily Rationale
The daily Platts TSI US Midwest shredded scrap index was
assessed at $385/lt on a delivered basis Dec. 28, unchanged from
the previous day.
No new bids, offers or transactions were reported for
December-delivered shredded scrap, as trading in December
volumes was complete, while trading in shredded scrap delivered
in January had yet to commence.
The above rationale applies to the daily Platts TSI shredded
scrap delivered US Midwest index with the associated market
data code FEMWD00.

Subscriber Notes
Platts to revise NWE Ferrochrome Low-Carbon coverage to
assess 60%-64.99% chrome and premium 65%-70% Cr content
Following market feedback, Platts, part of S&P Global Commodity
Insights, is to launch a weekly DDP NWE Ferrochrome LowCarbon 0.10% carbon, 60%-64.99% chrome assessment, and will
amend the existing weekly DDP NWE Ferrochrome Low-Carbon
0.10% Carbon assessment to reflect 65%-70% chrome content,
from 60%-70% currently, effective Feb. 1, 2023.
Platts will also revise volume specifications for the amended
low-carbon ferrochrome 65%-70% Cr DDP NWE assessment
and move the assessment publication to a single close value,
discontinuing associated high and low price points, with effect
from Feb. 1.
The changes were first proposed Nov. 4 in a subscriber note
available here: https://www.spglobal.com/commodityinsights/
en/our-methodology/subscriber-notes/110422-platts-proposesto-revise-nwe-ferrochrome-low-carbon-coverage-to-assess-60-

The decision to implement the proposed changes was
communicated in a subscriber note published Nov. 21*:
https://www.spglobal.com/commodityinsights/en/ourmethodology/subscriber-notes/112122-platts-to-revise-nweferrochrome-low-carbon-coverage-to-assess-60-6499-chromeand-premium-65-70-cr-content
Platts has observed a clear pricing distinction between lowcarbon ferrochrome with 60%-64.99% chrome content, sourced
typically from China and India, and the premium low-carbon
ferrochrome with 65%-70% chrome content, sourced typically
from Europe and Central Asian origins.
Platts has also observed an increase in market activity for
low-carbon ferrochrome with 60%-64.99% chrome content
DDP NWE in recent months as the Chinese domestic stainless
steel market weakened, widening the discount from premium
ferrochrome with a higher chrome content.
Under the changes, the existing low-carbon ferrochrome
assessment, under the symbol code MMAIL00, will be
amended to reflect 65%-70% Cr content, normalized to 67% Cr
content basis.
Platts will also revise the quantity specification to minimum
25 mt, from 200-500 mt currently, and specify that the material
is in lump form:

Platts proposes to revise NWE Ferrochrome Low-Carbon
specifications for silicon, sulfur, phosphorus content
Platts, part of S&P Global Commodity Insights, is proposing to
revise product specifications for its weekly Ferrochrome LowCarbon 0.10% DDP NWE assessment, under the symbol code
MMAIL00, to introduce silicon content and to amend sulfur and
phosphorus content, effective Feb. 1, 2023.
The proposed silicon, sulfur and phosphorus specifications
are as follows:
Current Specification Proposed Specification
Assessment symbol MMAIL00 MMAIL00
Silicon content N/A Maximum 1%
Sulfur content 0.05% Maximum 0.03%
Phosphorus content 0.05% Maximum 0.03%
Platts is also proposing the following specifications for silicon,
sulfur and phosphorus content in its new Ferrochrome LowCarbon 0.10% C, 60-64.99% Cr DDP NWE assessment due to
launch Feb. 1, 2023:
Proposed Specification
Silicon content Maximum 1.50%
Sulfur content Maximum 0.05%
Phosphorus content Maximum 0.05%
Platts invites feedback on this proposal by Jan. 3, 2023, to
ferrous_emea@spglobal.com and pricegroup@platts.com.
For written comments, please provide a clear indication if
comments are not intended for publication by Platts for public
viewing. Platts will consider all comments received and will make
comments not marked as confidential available upon request.
The proposed silicon, sulfur and phosphorus specifications
follow further feedback received in response to wider changes
taking effect in February 2023.
Under these changes, announced in November 2022, Platts is
revising its DDP NWE Ferrochrome Low-Carbon 0.10% coverage to
reflect 60-64.99% chrome content through the introduction of a
new assessment and premium 65-70% chrome content through
changes to the existing assessment.
Platts clarifies European low-carbon ferrochrome sulfur
content specification
Platts, part of S&P Global Commodity Insights, seeks to clarify
the sulfur content specification for its weekly Ferrochrome LowCarbon 0.10% DDP NWE assessment, as follows:
The assessment, with symbol code MMAIL00, reflects lowcarbon 0.10% ferrochrome on a DDP Northwest Europe basis,
with a 0.05% sulfur (S) content. Platts specifications currently
erroneously state a 0.05% silicon (Si) content.
Platts is updating the bulk ferroalloys section of its Global
Steel, Ferrous Scrap, Ferroalloys and Noble Alloy specifications

Platts proposes to revise Global Molybdenum Oxide Daily
Dealer assessment specifications
Platts, part of S&P Global Commodity Insights, is proposing to
update the specifications for its Global Molybdenum Oxide Daily
Dealer assessment, effective Feb. 20.
The proposal follows an open consultation, with feedback
invited in a subscriber note published Dec. 2: https://www.
spglobal.com/commodityinsights/en/our-methodology/
subscriber-notes/120222-platts-opens-consultation-on-globalmolybdenum-oxide-daily-dealer-assessment
Following initial market feedback, Platts is proposing the
following specification changes:
— Incoterms: Refining incoterms prioritized for the
assessment to in-warehouse (IW) and cost, insurance and freight
(CIF), normalizing market information heard on a delivered or
delivered duty unpaid (DDU) basis to IW.
— Locations: Narrowing Europe location specifications from
European ports to Rotterdam, narrowing South Korea location
specifications from South Korean ports to Busan.
— India duties: Normalizing indications reported on a CIF
Nhava Sheva/Mumbai basis to duty-free material.
— Product specifications: Reflecting material in 1mt bags, from
drummed material currently.
— Payment terms: Introducing a cash against documents
payment term specification, with scope for other payment terms
to be normalized to cash against documents.
Under this proposal, the incoterm and location bases
reflected in the assessment would be as follows:
— In-warehouse Rotterdam
— In bonded warehouse Tianjin
— In-warehouse Busan
— In-warehouse US
— CIF India
— CIF Japan
The proposed changes would serve to better reflect trading
activity and would allow for more granular normalization of
premium markets.
Platts is additionally proposing to apply a 4:30 pm London
timestamp to all daily assessments, ending the current practice
of early market close at 1 pm London time on the last working day
of the calendar month.
The assessment would continue to take into account all
information reported to Platts in the 24-hour period up to
4:30 pm London time each day.

Platts opens consultation on IOPEX domestic Chinese iron ore
port stock indices
Platts, part of S&P Global Commodity Insights, is opening a
consultation to invite feedback on the assessment methodology
and specifications for its IOPEX domestic Chinese iron ore port
stock indices.
www.GigaPaper.irSBB Steel Markets Daily December 28, 2022
© 2022 by S&P Global Inc. All rights reserved. 18
Platts daily IOPEX assessments, launched August 1, 2017,
reflect prices of medium-grade iron ore fines port stocks in
Northern China (Caofeidian and Jingtang) and Eastern China
(Rizhao and Qingdao) in Yuan/wmt. Platts IOPEX coverage
also includes brand assessments of Pilbara Blend Fines and
Newman Fines.
Platts additionally publishes the IOPEX 62% Fe import parity
price (IPP) for both regions in dollars per dry metric ton, after
accounting for port charges, VAT and the prevailing exchange
rate, allowing for more convenient comparisons to be made with
prices of seaborne cargoes.
The Chinese portside market complements the seaborne
market in the global iron ore supply chain. Spot trading of iron
ore stockpiles at the respective ports captures shorter domestic
delivery times and smaller lot sizes.
As part of its commitment to open and transparent pricing
and product specifications, Platts is seeking feedback on its
IOPEX assessments and methodology at a time of changing
conditions in the portside market with growth observed in trading
activity and number of participants. Platts invites comment from
all market participants and stakeholders on IOPEX specifications
including regions and locations, grades, brands and normalization
factors.
The full IOPEX specifications can be found here: https://www.
