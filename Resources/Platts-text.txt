Asia coking coal prices climb
as buying sentiment improves
 Fresh booking of Moranbah North
at $287/mt FOB Aus for Feb-loading
 Further narrowing of FOB/CFR pricing confirmed by deal done
Seaborne met coal PLV FOB Australia prices rose Dec. 23, as
improved buying interest resulted in deal done at higher levels.
Premium Low Vol was assessed up $6.75/mt on the day at
$285.75/mt FOB Australia, while delivered price to China rose $3/
mt on the day at $315/mt CFR China Dec. 23, according to the
Platts assessment.
The FOB Australia market heard a trade concluded Dec. 23
at $287/mt FOB Australia for 75,000 mt of Australian premium
mid-vol Moranbah North coal, with a Feb. 1–10 loading laycan. The
transaction was heard to have been sold to an international trader.
“With talks on the possibility of Australian coals re-entering
China, the upwards momentum of prices are encouraging buyers
to bid at higher levels just to secure a cargo, regardless for
position taking or due to restocking demand”, an international
trader said.
Iron ore market
Asian iron ore prices marginally
higher amid limited seaborne trading
 Scant seaborne and portside activity
 Lower-band alumina differential increases
 Domestic concentrate prices stable
Seaborne iron ore prices were slightly higher in Asia Dec. 23 amid
thin trading.
Platts assessed the 62% Fe Iron Ore Index at $112.5/dry mt
CFR North China Dec. 23, up $0.85/dmt from Dec. 22.
Seaborne market liquidity was thin during early Asian hours
because of limited buying interest. Pilbara Blend Fines tradeable
premium over the January IODEX average was relatively stable
from the previous day, according to several sources.
“[The market is] quiet as you can expect, [with] not much
change,” said an international trader source. Trading slowed
during the week, with mills not buying significant volumes in the
seaborne and portside markets.
Sources expect Chinese end-user buying interest for more

cost competitive cargoes because of margin woes. BHP Dec.
23 narrowed its January term contract discount for Jimblebar
Fines, or JMBF, a widely discounted medium grade fines product,
which has seen improved demand on the back of greater cost
effectiveness, sources said. JMBF additional brand spread
narrowed 5 cents/dmt on the day to 35 cents/dmt.
Low-alumina, high-silica cargoes also continued to see
improved liquidity, with some sources expecting a Musa Fines
tender that closed during the week to conclude at a discount of
about $3.80/dmt over the February IODEX average.
Lower-band 1%-2.5% alumina differential rose 20 cents/dmt
on the day to $2.5/dmt.
A steel mill source in northern China said they received firm
offers from local miners at Yuan 1,000/dmt Dec. 23 morning. It is
currently a sellers’ market and buyers can hardly book at a lower
price, therefore, the price level is tradeable, the source said.
Platts assessed the price of 66% Fe domestic concentrate
delivered to mills based in Tangshan at Yuan 1000/dmt,
unchanged on the week.
Trading was calm in the Shandong and Tangshan regions
during the morning session Dec. 23. As the weekend approaches
and given China’s COVID-19 situation, not much portside liquidity
has been seen, said a trader.
62% Fe IOPEX North China was assessed at Yuan 847/wmt
FOT Dec. 23, up Yuan 2/mt from Dec. 22, or at $113.39/dmt on an
import-parity basis. 62% Fe IOPEX East China was assessed at
Yuan 837/wmt FOT Dec. 23, down Yuan 3/wmt from Dec. 22, or at
$112.00/dmt on an import-parity basis.
Seaborne lump premiums were marginally higher amid mixed
views on current lump premiums. Platts assessed the spot lump
premium at 12 cents/dmtu Dec. 23, up 0.05 cents/dmtu from
Dec. 22.

BHP widens Jan iron ore term contract
discount for MACF, narrows JMBF: customers
 Yandi Fines term contract discount for January widens to 6.5%
 NBLLU term contract discount for January widens to $6.5/wmt
Mining major BHP term contract discounts for January-loading
Mining Area C Fines (MACF) and Yandi Fines widened to 1.5% and
6.5%, respectively, while narrowing to 5.25% for Jimblebar Fines
(JMBF) basis the January average of the 62% Fe iron ore indexes,
contract customers told S&P Global Commodity Insights Dec. 23.
MACF discount widened from 1% while JMBF discount narrowed
from 6.25% for December-loading cargoes, the customers added.
January-loading Newman Blend Lump Unscreened (NBLLU),
under the term contracts, saw its discount further widening to
$6.5/wmt over the January average of IODEX plus 62.5% lump
premium, from $5.6/wmt for December-loading NBLLU.
BHP did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Overall, numerous participants saw the January iron ore
term contract discounts of MACF and JMBF closely in line with
recently traded MACF floating discount equivalent and JMBF
floating discount levels on the seaborne market.
A large majority of S&P Global sources said the narrowed
discount for JMBF was unsurprising as buying interest from the
market was prominent.
Amid lasting margin woes of Chinese steel mills, demand for
more widely discounted cargoes continue to see favor as mills
keep their production costs low. “Demand for JMBF has recently
seen strength as it is currently a cost competitive product for
mills to use,” a Chinese trader source said.
On the other hand, the new discount released for MACF was
met with mixed views.
While sources saw the widening of MACF’s discount bringing it
to a more reasonable price level, some participants still hold the
stance that demand will likely remain stunted.
“It is still not cost effective enough at this level, especially
since there is also import loss for MACF currently,” another
Chinese trader source said.

Russia’s Metalloinvest lifts Lebedinsky’s
pelletizing capacity with upgrade
 Lifts capacity by over 200,000 mt/year
 Complex now needs less natural gas, electricity
 Group pelletizing capacity up
600,000-650,000 mt/year over Dec
Russian iron ore mining and steel company Metalloinvest said
Dec. 23 the pellet capacity of its flagship Lebedinsky mining and
beneficiating complex has increased by over 200,000 mt/year on
the upgrade at one of its four roasting machines.
Metalloinvest, a major global supplier of iron ore pellets and
hot-briquetted iron, has completed the upgrade of roasting
machine No. 4 at the pelletizing plant of Lebedinsky in the
Belgorod region in west Russia, it said.
As a result of the reconstruction, the design capacity of the
roasting machine has been increased by 10% to 2.5 million mt/
year of pellets, the production of which now requires less natural
gas and electricity with a positive impact on the cost. An installed
off-gas cleaning system reduces dust emissions by 50%, it added.
Metalloinvest invested Rb2 billion ($30 million) in the project.
In 2021, the complex produced 9 million mt of pellets using
its own concentrate with the bulk of this processed in-house
into 4.47 million mt of HBI. Over the same period, the mining
subsidiary sold outside the group 4 million mt of HBI, 2 million mt
of pellets and 4.66 million mt of concentrate.
This month, Metalloinvest has also completed the Rb1.9 billion
upgrade of the roasting machine at its special quality longrolled steelmaker OEMK in the same region, boosting the mill’s
pelletizing capacity by 10% to 4.5 million mt/year, corresponding
to 100% self-sufficiency of OEMK in pellets, S&P Global
Commodity Insights reported previously.

Therefore, this month alone, the overall pelletizing capacity of
Metalloinvest expanded by anything between 600,000 mt/year
and 650,000 mt/year.
Platts, part of S&P Global Commodity Insights, assessed the
62% Fe Iron Ore Index at $112.50/dry mt CFR North China on Dec.

Coking coal market
US low-vol coking coal prices rise
tracking seaborne market spreads
 US low-volatile HCC increases
 Thermal coal arbitrage weakens
Atlantic metallurgical coal markets on Dec. 23 took onboard
tight spot availability for US coals and higher pricing for premium
grade Australian coals.
CFR China index prices continued to generate lower FOB
prices for US suppliers compared with FOB indexes.
The Platts US East Coast low-volatile HCC benchmark
assessment went up $4/mt to $272/mt FOB Hampton Roads.
Platts US low-vol HCC is based on 58% CSR, 19.25% volatile
matter, 8.25% ash, and 0.95% sulfur.
Platts assessed the US low-vol HCC index $13.75/mt below
the Australian Premium Low Vol index of Dec. 23, based on
FOB terms.
The Platts US High Vol A index was up $1/mt to $271/mt FOB
USEC based on 32.25% volatile matter, 1.05% reflectance (MMR),
220% dilatation, 7.5% ash, 0.95% sulfur, 30,000 ddpm, and CSR
typically in the low 60s.
The Platts US High Vol B benchmark moved up $2/mt to $270/
mt FOB US East Coast based on 36% VM unblended product with
0.95% MMR, 160% dilatation, 8% ash, 1% sulfur, and 25,000 ddpm
fluidity.
Thermal coal markets saw no significant changes to European
delivered physical pricing and forward values, limiting potential
for high-vol B to secure stronger pricing.
Blue Creek No. 7 led the week on week increase in assessed
US brand pricing, rising to $285.75/mt FOB Mobile on Dec. 23,
on parity with PLV FOB Australia - higher than the China net
back value.

Scrap market
Turkish mills likely to continue to struggle
with firm scrap prices in early 2023
 Slow scrap collection, alternative demand likely to
support pricing
 Concerns remain over Turkish steel demand
 Market awaits details on revised EU waste shipment
regulation
Turkish deepsea import scrap prices are expected to remain
relatively firm over the first quarter of 2023, supported by tight
supply, posing a continued challenge to Turkish steel mill margins,
sources said.
Platts assessed Turkish bulk imports of premium heavy
melting scrap 1/2 (80:20) at $386.75/mt CFR Dec. 23, unchanged
day on day.
The assessment averaged $444.69/mt CFR over the year to
Dec. 23, down slightly from $463.43/mt CFR over 2021, despite
the assessment also reaching an all-time high of $665/mt CFR
March 16, as a result of raw material supply concerns fueled by
the Russian invasion of Ukraine in late February.
The LME scrap forward curve over January-March 2023 is in a
soft backwardation, with January contracts assessed by Platts at
$381.50/mt Dec. 23, while March contracts were at $379.50/mt.
This suggests future traders expect some softening in physical
prices in the near term, but prices are expected to remain
largely firm.
Scrap availability has remained tight amid lower industrial
activity and weak consumer confidence in the key ferrous scrap
exporting regions to Turkey, such as the UK, continental Europe,
the Baltics and the US. The usual seasonal downturn in scrap
collection rates during the winter has also hit supply.
Turkish mills struggled to remain competitive in the export
steel markets into the second half of 2022, relying mostly on
domestic steel demand, amid rising production costs caused by
sharp hikes in electricity and gas prices, as well as relatively firm
scrap prices.
Platts, part of S&P Global Commodity Insights, assessed the
daily outright spread between Turkish export rebar and import
PODCAST

scrap at $272.25/mt Dec. 23, reaching at its lowest level since
early September. Mills had previously attempted to target an
outright spread of around $300/mt to factor in higher scrap and
production costs but have had to accept a lower spread to catch
sales in the export rebar market.
Platts assessed Turkish export rebar at $659/mt FOB Turkey
Dec. 23, unchanged day on day.
In September, Turkish electricity prices rose 50%, and gas
prices for industrial use also rose 50.8%, while in October, gas
prices rose around 37.2% for industrial use. So far, market sources
aren’t expecting a further increase in gas and electricity prices in
January 2023.
“Come January, the new minimum wage will start to weigh on
mills’ costs, and margins are super squeezed already,” one Turkish
scrap agent said, referring to Turkish President Recep Tayyip
Erdoğan’s announcement Dec. 22 of a 55% increase in the Turkish
minimum wage to Lira 8,500 a month ($455), effective January
2023, in an attempt to ease the impact of rampant inflation
on workers, ahead of presidential elections due to take place
June 18.
“It is going to be challenging in 2023, but maybe before the
elections, the government will give some [support] package to
the industry,” a Turkish trader said. “I don’t expect the demand
to be much lower than this year, and it will be difficult for Turkish
mills stop production. The capacity utilization is already 50%-
55%, which is supported by the domestic market, but for more
capacity usage it needs to be better in the export market.”
Turkish market participants will also be looking closely at
how competing scrap demand develops from India, the world’s
second-largest crude steel producing nation after China, with
ambitions to reach an annual crude steel production of 300
million mt by 2030.
India became a key competitor to Turkey for scrap in the
second half of 2022, as high coal prices and high container
freights (India is a large importer of containerized scrap) made
bulk scrap cargoes more attractive pricewise.
According to S&P Global’s Commodities at Sea platform, India
imported about 951,300 mt of ferrous scrap in 26 bulk cargoes
since September 2022, with four further cargoes totaling 166,000
mt in transit as of Dec. 23.
Longer-term factors
Market participants will also be closely watching in January
2023 for the European Parliament’s plenary vote on the European
Commission’s proposed legislation on waste shipment exports.
Under the proposal, EU ferrous scrap exports to non-OECD
countries will only be allowed if they can be managed sustainably.
The time frame for implementation is unclear, but market sources
have previously voiced expectations of 2026.
The EU is the world’s largest exporter of ferrous scrap, with
2021 total export of ferrous metals scrap reaching 19.5 million mt,
according to Eurostat data.
Turkey, an OECD member, could theoretically benefit in terms
of reduced competition for material, should the legislation be
approved in its current guise. India, a non-OECD member, but a
growing scrap importer, could be affected.
Increased demand for ferrous scrap globally, and thus greater
competition for import-reliant Turkey, is likely to continue in
2023, as steel mills globally look to introduce a greater volume of
ferrous scrap into their raw materials mix as a part of a strategy
to reduce carbon emissions from production.

Severe winter weather hits
US ferrous scrap operations
 Severe cold front shutters many scrap, mini-mill operations
 Scrap supply impacts could further boost prices in January
The outlook for US ferrous scrap prices in January shifted further
to the upside in the week to Dec. 23, as much of the country
was affected by a severe cold front that shuttered many scrap
operations just before the Christmas holiday.
The Platts TSI US shredded scrap delivered Midwest index
was assessed unchanged at $385/lt Dec. 23, while No. 1 busheling
prices in the Midwest held steady at $380-$390/lt delivered.
An unusually powerful blast of cold air originating in the
Arctic began sweeping through the Upper Midwest Dec. 22,
sending temperatures well below the freezing point as far south
as Texas. Many scrapyards decided to halt operations until after
the Christmas holiday as the severe weather conditions were
expected to be short-lived.
“In a rare move for a scrap company, we will be shutting down
some of our facilities due to weather at the close of business
on Thursday,” a scrap dealer in the Midwest said. “We’ll be back
on Tuesday. Negotiations for the January trade will heavily favor
sellers. It’s going to be interesting watching this one develop.”
Both buy-side and sell-side sources said they expected scrap
prices to rebound further in January after December monthly
settlements reversed a seven-month downturn in domestic
prime and shredded scrap prices in the Midwest.
Many participants had initially expected January price hikes
of about $50/lt delivered for No. 1 busheling and $20-$30/lt for
shredded scrap and cut grades, citing increased consumption
by steelmakers as finished steel prices rose and relatively

tight supply conditions. But those expectations may have been
conservative as the supply impact of halted scrap operations was
considered, a steelmaker in the South said.
“I don’t think the winter storm was being priced into the scrap
numbers when it started looking upwards over the last two
weeks,” the steelmaker said. “The scrap freezes to the ground,
and all the equipment, which is often not indoors, will be difficult
to restart and run over the next two weeks.
“2023 could start in an interesting fashion.”
Platts assessed No. 1 busheling prices in the South at $400/
lt delivered Dec. 23, unchanged from one week earlier, while
shredded scrap prices in the South held steady at $390/lt
delivered.

CFR Taiwan containerized scrap
prices gain with fewer offers
 Scrap flow low; sellers bullish
 HRS 101 rises with spot demand from South Korea
Containerized scrap prices to Taiwan rose in the week ended
Dec. 23 as deal levels continued to strengthen, fewer offers were
received in the wake of holidays, and sellers took a bullish view
for January.
Platts assessed the daily heavy melting 1/2 80:20 CFR Taiwan
containerized scrap price up $7/mt at $382/mt in the week ended
Dec. 23.
“I don’t have container cargo offers today as my US suppliers
are watching the marker carefully when scrap flow is slow and
domestic market sentiment in January is up,” said a Taiwanbased trader.
US-origin cargo offers were heard in the $380-$385/mt range
over the week. “We concluded a deal today at $375/mt based on
an offer received yesterday that remains valid today,” a Taiwanbased mill source said.
A deal for a US-origin 2,000-mt cargo was done at $382/mt
Dec. 23. Another deal for an Australia-origin 1,000-mt cargo was
concluded at $378/mt CFR Taiwan basis.
Offers for Japanese mini-bulk H1/H2 50:50 grade were heard
at $410/mt on a CFR Taiwan basis Dec. 23, but buyers were
targeting $390/mt. No deals were heard done Dec. 23. Earlier in
the week, various deals concluded in the $390-$395/mt range.
HRS 101 price continues to gain
Heavy recycled steel prices on a CFR China basis rose $6/mt
to $439/mt in the week ended Dec. 23, supported by sustained
spot demand from South Korea.
The arbitrage into China has been closed, but steady demand
for the Japanese HS grade, similar to HRS 101, supported prices.
South Korea’s Hyundai possibly bought 22,000 mt of HS at Yen
54,000/mt on an FOB Japan basis Dec. 21. Prices were Yen 1,000/
mt higher than its last tender.
“I think tradable for HS on an FOB Japan basis would be Yen
54,000/mt ($407/mt) following the Hyundai deal,” a South Koreabased trading source said. Another Japan-based trading source,
who did not receive any bids or buying indications for HS Dec. 23,
agreed with the South Korea-based trading source.
“Mills have no reason to rush to pay up for HS, since it’s end of
year holidays and Japanese New Year soon,” said another South
Korea-based trading source. “Domestic mills have already raised
domestic scrap bidding prices and may raise price further if they
need urgently HS-grade cargoes.”
Offers for Japanese HS were heard at Yen 54,000/mt but no
deals were concluded. “Mills are not in a rush to buy, current
import cargoes prices are too high,” said a South Korea-based
mill source.
Both Heavy A and Light A scrap rose by a total of Won 40,000/
mt in the week to Dec. 23 to Won 500,000-Won 505,000/mt
($390-$394/mt) and Won 470,000-Won 480,000/mt, respectively,
sources said, adding that another increase of Won 50,000/mt
may be expected in the week starting Dec. 26.
China’s domestic recycled steel market slipped, with
Shagang lowering its domestic bidding prices by Yuan 50/mt
to Yuan 3,040/mt ($435/mt) in Jiangsu for 6 mm and above
recycled steel delivered to its mills, including value added
taxes.” Market sentiment was negatively impacted, as China
fights new waves of COVID-19 cases, finished steel products
prices also fell amid reduced economic activity,” said a Chinabased trading source.
FAS collection prices for HS grade in Kanto were stable during
week in the Yen 51,000-Yen 52,000/mt range.

India containerized import shredded scrap
prices inch down as buyers hold back
 Demand weak in Indian mills amid healthy scrap inventories
 Four bulk scrap cargoes currently in transit to India: CAS
Import prices for containerized shredded ferrous scrap in India
inched down over the week to Dec. 23, as mills held back from
purchasing, sources said.
Platts assessed Indian imports of containerized shredded
scrap at $435/mt CFR Nhava Sheva Dec. 23, down $1/mt week
on week.
“Mills are not buying at the moment as they have sufficient
material in pipeline, they should be in the market sometime
in mid-January,” an Indian mill source said, citing an indicative
tradable value for containerized shredded scrap at $435/mt CFR
Nhava Sheva maximum.
One trader reported a deal booked Dec. 20 for 2,000 mt
containerized shredded scrap at $445/mt CFR Nhava Sheva, but
added that major customers were not bidding, and this level was
not deemed repeatable on Dec. 23.
“The market is very quiet in India, firstly because a lot of
bulk vessels arrived in India, which were bought a couple
of months back, so there is good scrap availability in India,
00989035556564info@GigaPaper.ir

and secondly, rebar demand is very poor in India,” the same
trader said.
Buyers were seeking below $435/mt CFR Nhava Sheva for
containerized shredded scrap on Dec. 23 with not many sellers
willing to sell at $435/mt CFR Nhava Sheva, the trader added.
According to S&P Global Commodities At Sea (CAS) platform,
India has imported about 1.13 million mt of ferrous scrap in 31 bulk
cargoes since Aug. 1, with four cargoes from the US and UK —
totaling 166,000 mt — currently in transit.
Two other Indian traders cited indicative tradable values for
containerized shredded scrap at $435/mt CFR Nhava Sheva
maximum.
In the neighboring Pakistan market, limited deals were heard
over the week, with a 500 mt deal booked earlier in the week
started Dec. 19 at $442/mt CFR Port Qasim for a cargo already in
transit, while a 2,000 mt deal was also done Dec. 21-22 at $440/
mt CFR Port Qasim.
Bids were heard lower at $435/mt CFR Port Qasim, but no
deals were heard at this level.
“I suppose if someone was pushing to sell then they might
take lower [than $440/mt CFR], but mostly it’s quiet – the
expectation is for a bit of demand to come back as scrap supply
in the local market is low and the LC situation is slowly improving,”
a UK trader said.
Trade of containerized shredded scrap continues to be
hindered by a lack of letters of credit (LCs) being opened by
Pakistani banks, amid concerns over low US dollar reserves
in the country, market sources told S&P Global Commodity
Insights.

Pig iron
Black Sea merchant pig iron prices stable
in quiet market; Russian mills eye China
Black Sea merchant pig iron prices were flat in a seasonally
quieter market, with Russian suppliers holding back in the hope
for Chinese demand in the new year.
Inquiries from the Chinese market continued to be seen,
according to market participants. “I have inquiries from China for
iron ore concentrate and pig iron, but the prices China wants are
unfortunately not workable,” a trading source in Europe said.
Chinese buyers’ target prices ranged $425-$435/mt CFR.
“Now everyone will be waiting for the opening of China
following COVID restrictions and an increase in demand,” a
Russian trader said. He cited recent bids at $430/mt CFR China
but expected the workable prices to move up.
In the Turkish market, the indications for Russian imported
pig iron were somewhat lower in the week, between $360-$365/
mt FOB Black Sea. A week prior, the achievable price level in the
Turkish market was indicated at $370/mt FOB Black Sea. No
recent transactions to Turkey were reported.
A Turkish trader said that local pig iron importers would target
$360-$365/mt FOB Black Sea for Russian pig iron in case some
suppliers were still under pressure to sell. “With $385-$390/mt
CFR for [heavy melting] scrap, I think they’ll push $350-$360/
mt FOB, $385-$390[/mt] CFR Turkey [for pig iron]. Suppliers are
looking for $20-$30/mt more,” the Turkish trader added.
A Russian mill source reported offers at $480/mt CIF Italy,
which worked back to $440/mt FOB Black Sea. The mill’s quality
is superior to other basic pig iron produced in Russia and

warranted a premium. A trading source put a feasible price level
for the Italian market at $460/mt CIF, with buyers targeting $430-
$440/mt CIF.
“At $480/mt CIF Italy, nobody will buy in my opinion. The level
is $410-$420/mt CIF for good volume and a reliable supplier,”
an Italian importer said. Previously, the source was putting a
workable level at $410/mt CIF.

Brazil’s export pig iron prices to test higher levels
 High lump ore, charcoal production costs worry producers
 Latest deals inked to the US and Mexico
The Brazilian merchant pig iron price remained largely
stagnant in the spot market Dec. 23, despite some attempts
to raise offers on the back of high production costs and
reduced supply.
The Platts weekly Brazilian basic pig iron export price was
unchanged at $445/mt FOB on Dec. 23 based on the most
repeatable range of offers, bids and indicative tradable values at
$440-$450/mt.
In a trader’s view, the drop in prices seen through November
and early December was unnecessary, considering that Brazil is
an isolated supply player for the American market. Thus, a price
positioning process was initiated to reduce buyers’ pressure,
he added.
“We are really focused on returning to the $500/mt FOB price
level”, the trader said.
However, there were some risks being evaluated, such as
the foreign exchange in the first quarter and suppliers’ ability to
commit with deliveries, since a great portion of furnaces in the
Southeast having shut down.
While Brazilian pig iron producers were working on production
cost reduction with lump providers, others continued testing
the market at higher levels in order to justify the continuity or
resumption of operations.
A second trader heard tentative offers sent to the US at
$470/mt FOB.
A local Brazilian producer said that most of companies were
on stand-by mode, watching scrap material rising in the US and
analyzing the effects of the rainy season in Brazil.
“Many mills stopping production due to lack of charcoal
availability, and many domestic market customers [foundries
and steel mills] going on collective vacation”, he said, adding
that until March, his company would produce at half of its
capacity, a period in which it would take advantage of internal
maintenance.
Deals for shipments in February to the US and Mexico were
reported during the week in the range of $440-$445/mt FOB for
volumes greater than 30,000 mt.

US pig iron import prices hold
steady as supplies dwindle
 Import prices maintain $500/mt CIF New Orleans level
 Shipment arrivals rebound in December to 364,000 mt
US pig iron import prices held steady in the week to Dec. 23 as
most suppliers were sold out of available cargoes with January
loading dates.
The weekly Platts US pig iron import price was assessed
at $500/mt CIF New Orleans Dec. 23, unchanged from the
week prior.
There were no reports of bids or offers in the market as pig
iron producers in Brazil were mostly sold out of export cargoes
until at least February, the next of which would be brought to
market in the new year.
Pig iron import arrivals were already at least 364,000 mt by
the third week of December, the largest monthly total since July,
according to Panjiva, the trade analysis unit of S&P Global Market
Intelligence.
Total US import volumes for 2022 have topped 4 million
mt, despite the disruption to normal supply lines since Russia
invaded neighboring Ukraine in late February. Ukraine finally
overcame Russia to be the second-largest supplier of pig iron
to the US for the year in February, at 620,000 mt compared to
Russia’s 602,500 mt, according to Panjiva.
US imports of Russian pig iron were heavily concentrated
in the January-March period, while Ukraine recovered and
maintained moderate export volumes to the US since June by
railing cargoes to Polish Baltic Sea ports for shipment.

Metals market watchers upbeat on 2023 price,
demand prospects after sluggish start
 Weaker dollar may buoy metals prices
 Copper set to continue investors’ favorite
 Uncertainty seen over speed of energy transition
 More M&A activity expected
Metals prices may claw back in 2023 as the US dollar weakens
and the appetite for mergers and acquisitions in the metals
space sharpens, according to producers’, analysts’ and
economists’ views in the week of Dec. 19.
Surprises may occur, but the overall sentiment is positive,
according to Jefferies International. UBS and ActivTrades
meanwhile see geopolitical and energy risks, particularly in
Europe, continuing to cloud a recessionary backdrop while China

shows mixed demand recovery.
It will still be in vogue to be bullish copper, needed for all
aspects of electrification, diversified miners including Eurasian
Resources Group (ERG) and Vale agree. Metals in general are
seen performing well as longer-term demand continues for
energy transition materials.
“We believe the [metals and mining] sector in general is poised
to materially outperform the broader equity markets once again,”
said Jefferies analysts led by Chris LaFemina. “Chinese demand
for base metals should stabilize in 1H23 [H1 2023] and improve
as the year progresses, offsetting what is likely to be weaker
demand in the US and Europe. Meanwhile, supply constraints
are worsening and inventories are very low. We expect most
commodity prices to end 2023 higher than where they are today.
Mining shares should outperform once again. Copper miners
are best.”
A weaker US dollar following successive Fed rate hikes will
help buoy prices of dollar-denominated metals: ActivTrades
senior analyst Ricardo Evangelista noted the greenback
approached a six-month low during Dec. 22 trading.
A year to forget
2022 was both unpredictable and exceptional.
“2022 has seen most commodity prices sold off sharply
– however, this was largely due to specific disruptive shortterm price drivers, including COVID-19 lockdowns in China
[which have recently loosened], monetary policy in the US,
and the fallout from the energy crisis caused by the military
conflict between Russia and Ukraine,” said Benedikt Sobotka,
ERG’s CEO.
“We expect the impact of all these factors to resolve or ease
off in 2023. Furthermore, we believe the market has overreacted
and is at odds with actual state of most commodity markets.
We anticipate that the demand structure for many commodities
is undergoing a fundamental shift driven by the global net-zero
transition.”
ERG expects copper next year to “turbocharge” back towards
the $10,000/mt level exceeded after Russia’s Feb. 24 invasion of
Ukraine sparked fears of market tightness. Copper prices went
on to fall more than 25% between April and November even as
inventories slumped 60%, on weaker economic indicators, said
UBS analysts led by Daniel Major.
UBS forecasts an average price for “Dr Copper” – considered
a barometer of economic activity and industrial production – at a
more measured $6,600/mt in 2023, as “energy transition sectors
will not be enough to offset slowing demand from traditional end
use sectors,” amid a recessionary backdrop in Europe/US and
mixed demand recovery in China. Still, “longterm fundamentals
for copper look compelling and arguably better now than 6-9
months ago,” it said.
Vale is betting with its diggers. At this month’s Vale Day
at the New York Stock Exchange it announced plans to
boost copper output to 900,000 mt/year from 2030, from
260,000 mt this year, with nickel output to grow to above
300,000 mt/year from 2030, from around 175,000 mt/year
at present, and to attract a strategic investment partner
to boot.
The London Metal Exchange 3 months copper price closed at
$8,399/mt Dec. 22, down $62.50/mt on day, and down 14% from
the year’s start.
Russia still present
Russia, the target of many sanctions due to its war in
Ukraine, is a substantial producer and exporter of copper and
aluminum, as well as supplying some 15% of the world’s battery
grade nickel.
Russian metals can, however, still be officially traded on the
LME and stored in the exchange’s warehouses, according to a
decision taken by the exchange and its members seeking to
maintain market stability.
Despite the continuing presence of Russian metals on many
markets, primary aluminum, copper, nickel and tin markets have
continued in deficit this year, partly due to smelter cuts as energy
prices soared, the World Bureau of Metals Statistics reported
mid-December.
Following a weak H1 2023 as Chinese demand recovers,
Jefferies forecasts some recovery in prices not only of copper
but also of aluminum, zinc and iron ore later next year.
Not all roses
Uncertainties persist on how fast the metals-hungry energy
transition may develop in the current economic climate.
S&P Global Commodity Insights’ Metals and Mining Research
team expects lithium and cobalt prices to be pressured in coming
months due to weakening plug-in electric vehicle sales and rising
COVID-19 infections in China. Goldman Sachs and other analysts
in recent weeks predicted substantial downwards correction in
lithium as new projects come on stream worldwide in coming
months or years: following a price-doubling this year for the vital
ingredient for lithium-ion batteries.
Platts assessed lithium carbonate at $75,000/mt CIF North
Asia Dec. 20, up 122% since the start of 2022.
What’s more, “there is more pronounced unease in the cobalt
market, as the end of the PEV subsidy in China could potentially
accelerate the shift away from cobalt-intensive NMC532 and
NMC622 batteries,” S&P Global Commodity Insights’ analyst
Alice Yu said in Dec. 20 report. High cobalt prices in recent
years have led a shift away from relatively pricy NMC (nickelmanganese-cobalt) products.
M&A
Following a spate of depressed company share values
earlier in 2022, the stage looks set for merger & acquisition
opportunities.
In the week of Dec.19 alone, China approved China Baowu
Steel Group Corp’s takeover of Sinosteel Corp. in a further
consolidation of the Chinese steel sector, while miner BHP came
a step closer to its proposed takeover of Australian copper

Vale makes strategic changes with an eye
on decarbonization, energy transition trends
 ‘Iron Solutions’ to work with clients on decarbonization
 Longstanding CFO Siani to leave company
 Vale awaits entry of new base metals partner
Following a simplification of its portfolio in recent years, with an
exit from steel assets in various locations, coal in Mozambique
and a nickel project in New Caledonia, the board of Brazil’s Vale
has approved a new executive structure to support the mining
and processing company’s development as it meets new market
demands, it announced Dec. 23.
“This evolution ensures greater attention to core assets,
accelerating improvement and innovation in high-quality
products and solutions for the global energy transition,” it said in
a statement.
An executive vice-presidency of Iron Solutions has been
created to accelerate the development of innovative products
and solutions in iron ore which aims to provide value creation to
customers, shareholders and society in the steel decarbonization
process, the company said. This vice-presidency will be under
the leadership of Marcello Spinelli, previously ferrous minerals
executive vice-president.
An executive vice-presidency of Operations has also been
created in the company’s iron ore business, under the leadership
of Carlos Medeiros. This will manage mining, pelletizing and
logistics operations, and aims to deepen process standardization
and promote greater safety, operational stability, flexibility and
efficiency for Vale’s production, the company said.
An executive vice-presidency of Projects has been created,
under the leadership of Alexandre Pereira, to implement key
strategic projects, while a technical executive vice-presidency,
under Rafael Bittar, current director of geotechnics, will look after
safety, operational innovation and mineral exploration.
The executive vice-presidency of Strategy and Business
Transformation has been extinguished, and the current executive
vice president in this area, Luciano Siani Pires, will leave Vale in
January 2023. Siani, with Vale since 2008, has designed Vale’s
strategy for the next 20 years, the company said.
“I am sure that the Executive Committee’s new design will give
the Company the required agility and focus to seize opportunities
brought by the energy revolution, with the creation and sharing
of long-term value for our stakeholders,” Eduardo Bartolomeo,
Vale’s CEO.
No specific change was announced in the miner’s base metals
operations. However, Vale in H1 2023 may announce a choice of a
strategic partner to take a shareholding of up to 10% in its base
metals operation, which is being “ringfenced” from the rest of the
company, and will be independent from its iron ore operation,
executives said at the Vale Day event at the New York Stock
Exchange Dec. 7.
Seaborne iron ore prices were slightly higher in Asia Dec. 23
amid thin trading.

Algerian Qatari Steel to expand
product range with new equipment
 Danieli to supply new equipment
 Startup of equipment seen in Q4 2024
Steel producer Algerian Qatari Steel has contracted Italian
engineering company Danieli for a plant upgrade to expand the
product range as well as the productivity of small sizes.
AQS’s bar mill operating in hot-charge mode and producing
16 to 40 mm diameter will be upgraded with the installation of
additional equipment to be able also to produce small sizes, such
as 12, 14 and 16 mm-diameter on two strands, Danieli said in a
statement late Dec. 22.
One new convertible stand, four new gearboxes and a
two-strand water quenching and tempering box will also be
installed.
The company’s five-strand billet caster No. 1, which is currently
producing 150-mm square billets, will be equipped with new
moulds and a secondary cooling system to also cast 130 mm
sections and allow energy savings for the production of the
smallest rolled bars.
The implementation of the new equipment is planned by the
fourth quarter of 2024.
AQS is an investment partnership between the Algerian
government and Qatar. The company started production and
marketing of iron products in Bellara, Algeria, at the end of 2017,
based on initial production capacity of 2 million mt/year of rebar
and wire rod of various diameters.
AQS has a DRI plant with 2.5 million mt/year of capacity, two
EAFs with 2.2 million mt/year of capacity, and three rolling mills
producing 2 million mt/year of steel.
The global long steel product market has been facing cost
pressures amid rising raw material costs and energy prices,
according to the International Rebar Producers & Exporters
Association.
Platts, part of S&P Global Commodity Insights, assessed
Turkish exported rebar at $659/mt FOB Dec. 22, down from an
intra-year high of $960/mt FOB on April 1.

Freight
Capesize freight rates little changed on thin activity
 Rates out of Atlantic lower despite tight tonnage availability
 More ships available for loading Jan 20 onward out of Brazil
Capesize freight rates in the Pacific remained flat Dec. 23 amid
thin activity, while rates out of the Atlantic basin dipped slightly.
The market was “unsurprisingly” quiet given the time of the
year, multiple market sources said.
In the Pacific, Vale was heard seeking a Capesize ship
from Teluk Rubiah in Malaysia to Qingdao in China for Jan. 1-2,
2023, laycan.
FMG was heard seeking a Capesize ship from Port Hedland in
Western Australia to Qingdao for loading Jan. 8 onward. Indicative
offers were heard around $8.75/wmt Dec. 23.
Platts assessed the freight rate for a Capesize ship to move
170,000 mt (plus/minus 10%) of iron ore from Port Hedland to
Qingdao at $8.50/wmt Dec. 23, unchanged from Dec. 22.
In the Atlantic basin, details around a few fixtures concluded
late Dec. 22 emerged and they were lower than fixtures done
earlier in the week, market sources said.
“Although some fixtures done on Thursday are a bit lower,
there is not an abundance of ships for prompt dates to do Brazil
or West Africa,” a ship chartering source with a miner said.
“Jan. 20 onward there are a few more offers, albeit a bit high
at the moment,” the source added, noting that there were at least
ships being marketed for those dates.
Kingho was linked to a couple of Newcastlemaxes for moving
iron ore from Pepel in Sierra Leone to China for Jan. 7-11 and Jan.
24-27 laycans around $21/wmt, but no details were confirmed.
Platts assessed the freight rate for a Capesize ship to move
170,000 mt (plus/minus 10%) of iron ore from Tubarao in Brazil to
Qingdao at $22/wmt Dec. 23, down $1/wmt from Dec. 22.
Out of South Africa, a Capesize ship was heard fixed for coal
from Richards Bay Coal Terminal to Gangavaram on east coast
India for Jan. 15-24 laycan around $9/mt, excluding port charges
at the discharge port.
Platts assessed the freight rate for a Capesize ship to move
170,000 mt (plus/minus 10%) of iron ore from Saldanha Bay in
South Africa to Qingdao at $15.25/wmt Dec. 23, unchanged from
Dec. 22.

Asia coking coal prices climb as
buying sentiment improves ...from page 1
“On a freight forward adjusted FOB Australia price basis, the
traded level narrows the gap between the CFR China prices,
further attributing the recent price uptrend to the possibility
of thawing of trade relationship between China-Australia”, an
international trader said.
However, the trader added that it remains uncertain if the
price increase will sustain as buying interest from end-users in
the international market remains muted for now, especially with
re-stocking activities completed for most mills.
In the CFR China market, prices continued to observe climb
as market participants said the routine restocking demand
continued to provide support to the current levels.
Tradable values were heard at $300-$320/mt CFR China
for US Premium Low Vol Blue Creek No. 7 coals with an H2
December-loading laycan.
“Current price levels remains reasonable for steel mills
with production requirements to procure at, considering how
domestic coals are at well-sustained high price levels, giving
support for slight uptick in prices”, a trader said.
“Steel mills are starting to maintain a cautious stance
for weak grades of coal like, Russian PCI coals with buying
interest looking at the $245-$250s/mt CFR China range despite
demand for PCI coal still remaining relatively stable”, a Chinese
trader said.
At Jingtang port, port-side prices climbed briefly as routine
and winter restocking demand continued, with most steel mills
observing relatively lower coal inventories previously, providing
support to immediate port stocks prices.
Platts assessed PLV ex-stock Jingtang up Yuan 50/mt at Yuan
2650/mt Dec. 23, equivalent to $332.13/mt CFR Jingtang and
Low Vol HCC ex-stock Jingtang up Yuan 50/mt at Yuan 2400/mt,

A Turkish trader cited an indicative tradable value for US/
Baltic-origin HMS 1/2 (80:20) at $386-$387/mt CFR.
One Turkish mill source cited indicative tradable values for USorigin HMS 1/2 (80:20) at $387-$388/mt CFR, and for Baltic-origin
HMS 1/2 (80:20) at $381/mt CFR.
A second mill source said prices could move closer to $390/
mt CFR in the near-term for US/Baltic-origin HMS 1/2 (80:20) but
added that mills were already paying more than they should.
One Turkish agent source said the seller of US/Baltic-origin
HMS 1/2 (80:20) will push for $390/mt CFR and above, adding that
buyers would look to buy at $387-$388/mt CFR.
An EU scrap recycler cited an indicative tradable value for
Benelux-origin HMS 1/2 (80:20) around $380-$382/mt CFR but
expected some increase in the near term.
A UK trader said that below $380/mt CFR for premium HMS
1/2 (80:20) was more workable for Turkish mills, with even $385/
mt CFR unlikely to be profitable for Turkish mills.
No data was excluded from the assessment.

The above rationale applies to the Platts-TSI assessment of
Turkish premium deep sea HMS 1/2 (80:20) imports, with the
associated market data code: TS01011
Platts US Shredded Scrap Midwest Daily Rationale
The daily Platts TSI US Midwest shredded scrap index was
assessed at $385/lt on a delivered basis Dec. 23, unchanged from
the previous day.
No new bids, offers or transactions were reported for
December-delivered shredded scrap as the market prepared for
the Christmas holiday weekend.
The above rationale applies to the daily Platts TSI shredded
scrap delivered US Midwest index with the associated market
data code FEMWD00.

Platts Asia Indian Shredded Scrap Weekly Rationale
Platts assessed Indian imports of containerized shredded scrap
at $435/mt CFR Nhava Sheva Dec. 23, down $1/mt week on week.
One trader reported a deal booked Dec. 20 for 2,000 mt
containerized shredded scrap at $445/mt CFR Nhava Sheva, but
added that major customers were not bidding, and this level was
not deemed repeatable on Dec. 23.
The same trader said buyers were seeking below $435/mt CFR

Nhava Sheva for containerized shredded scrap on Dec. 23 but
added that not many sellers were willing to sell at $435/mt CFR
Nhava Sheva.
An Indian mill source cited an indicative tradable value for
containerized shredded scrap at $435/mt CFR Nhava Sheva
maximum but said that buyers were not in the market amid
sufficient supply.
Two other Indian traders cited indicative tradable values for
containerized shredded scrap at $435/mt CFR Nhava Sheva
maximum.
No data was excluded from the assessment.

Platts to revise NWE Ferrochrome Low-Carbon coverage
to assess 60%-64.99% chrome and premium
65%-70% Cr content
Following market feedback, Platts, part of S&P Global
Commodity Insights, is to launch a weekly DDP NWE
Ferrochrome Low-Carbon 0.10% carbon, 60%-64.99% chrome
assessment, and will amend the existing weekly DDP NWE
Ferrochrome Low-Carbon 0.10% Carbon assessment to reflect
65%-70% chrome content, from 60%-70% currently, effective
Feb. 1, 2023.
Platts will also revise volume specifications for the amended
low-carbon ferrochrome 65%-70% Cr DDP NWE assessment
and move the assessment publication to a single close value,
discontinuing associated high and low price points, with effect
from Feb. 1, 2023.
The changes were first proposed Nov. 4 in a subscriber note
available here: https://www.spglobal.com/commodityinsights/
en/our-methodology/subscriber-notes/110422-platts-proposesto-revise-nwe-ferrochrome-low-carbon-coverage-to-assess-60-
6499-chrome-and-premium-65-70-cr-content
Platts has observed a clear pricing distinction between
low-carbon ferrochrome with 60%-64.99% chrome
content, sourced typically from China and India, and the
premium low-carbon ferrochrome with 65%-70% chrome
content, sourced typically from Europe and Central Asian
origins.
Platts has also observed an increase in market activity
for low-carbon ferrochrome with 60%-64.99% chrome
content DDP NWE in recent months as the Chinese
domestic stainless steel market weakened, widening the
discount from premium ferrochrome with a higher chrome
content.
Under the changes, the existing low-carbon ferrochrome
assessment, under the symbol code MMAIL00, will be
amended to reflect 65%-70% Cr content, normalized to 67% Cr
content basis.

The assessment, with symbol code MMAIL00, reflects lowcarbon 0.10% ferrochrome on a DDP Northwest Europe basis,
with a 0.05% sulfur (S) content. Platts specifications currently
erroneously state a 0.05% silicon (Si) content.
Platts is updating the bulk ferroalloys section of its Global
Steel, Ferrous Scrap, Ferroalloys and Noble Alloy specifications
guide according to the above clarification.
A link to the guide can be found here: https://www.spglobal.
com/commodityinsights/PlattsContent/_assets/_files/en/
our-methodology/methodology-specifications/steel-ferrousmethodology.pdf
The assessment is published in Platts Metals Daily, Steel
Business Briefing, Steel Markets Daily, Steel Price Report, via
Platts Metals Alert on Page 9065, on Platts Dimensions Pro and
in the Platts price database.

Platts to revise NWE Ferrochrome Low-Carbon coverage to
assess 60%-64.99% chrome and premium 65%-70% Cr content
Following market feedback, Platts, part of S&P Global
Commodity Insights, is to launch a weekly DDP NWE
Ferrochrome Low-Carbon 0.10% carbon, 60%-64.99% chrome
assessment, and will amend the existing weekly DDP NWE
Ferrochrome Low-Carbon 0.10% Carbon assessment to reflect
65%-70% chrome content, from 60%-70% currently, effective
Feb. 1, 2023.
Platts will also revise volume specifications for the amended
low-carbon ferrochrome 65%-70% Cr DDP NWE assessment
and move the assessment publication to a single close value,
discontinuing associated high and low price points, with effect
from Feb. 1.
The changes were first proposed Nov. 4 in a subscriber note
available here: https://www.spglobal.com/commodityinsights/
en/our-methodology/subscriber-notes/110422-platts-proposesto-revise-nwe-ferrochrome-low-carbon-coverage-to-assess-60-
6499-chrome-and-premium-65-70-cr-content
The decision to implement the proposed changes was
communicated in a subscriber note published Nov. 21*:
https://www.spglobal.com/commodityinsights/en/ourmethodology/subscriber-notes/112122-platts-to-revise-nweferrochrome-low-carbon-coverage-to-assess-60-6499-chromeand-premium-65-70-cr-content
Platts has observed a clear pricing distinction between lowcarbon ferrochrome with 60%-64.99% chrome content, sourced
typically from China and India, and the premium low-carbon
ferrochrome with 65%-70% chrome content, sourced typically
from Europe and Central Asian origins.
Platts has also observed an increase in market activity for
low-carbon ferrochrome with 60%-64.99% chrome content
DDP NWE in recent months as the Chinese domestic stainless
steel market weakened, widening the discount from premium
ferrochrome with a higher chrome content.
Under the changes, the existing low-carbon ferrochrome
assessment, under the symbol code MMAIL00, will be

Platts proposes to revise Global Molybdenum
Oxide Daily Dealer assessment specifications
Platts, part of S&P Global Commodity Insights, is proposing to
update the specifications for its Global Molybdenum Oxide Daily
Dealer assessment, effective Feb. 20.
The proposal follows an open consultation, with feedback
invited in a subscriber note published Dec. 2: https://www.

spglobal.com/commodityinsights/en/our-methodology/
subscriber-notes/120222-platts-opens-consultation-on-globalmolybdenum-oxide-daily-dealer-assessment
Following initial market feedback, Platts is proposing the
following specification changes:
— Incoterms: Refining incoterms prioritized for the
assessment to in-warehouse (IW) and cost, insurance and freight
(CIF), normalizing market information heard on a delivered or
delivered duty unpaid (DDU) basis to IW.
— Locations: Narrowing Europe location specifications from
European ports to Rotterdam, narrowing South Korea location
specifications from South Korean ports to Busan.
— India duties: Normalizing indications reported on a CIF
Nhava Sheva/Mumbai basis to duty-free material.
— Product specifications: Reflecting material in 1mt bags, from
drummed material currently.
— Payment terms: Introducing a cash against documents
payment term specification, with scope for other payment terms
to be normalized to cash against documents.
Under this proposal, the incoterm and location bases
reflected in the assessment would be as follows:
— In-warehouse Rotterdam
— In bonded warehouse Tianjin
— In-warehouse Busan
— In-warehouse US
— CIF India
— CIF Japan
The proposed changes would serve to better reflect trading
activity and would allow for more granular normalization of
premium markets.
Platts is additionally proposing to apply a 4:30 pm London
timestamp to all daily assessments, ending the current practice
of early market close at 1 pm London time on the last working day
of the calendar month.
The assessment would continue to take into account all
information reported to Platts in the 24-hour period up to 4:30
pm London time each day.

Platts opens consultation on IOPEX
domestic Chinese iron ore port stock indices
Platts, part of S&P Global Commodity Insights, is opening a
consultation to invite feedback on the assessment methodology
and specifications for its IOPEX domestic Chinese iron ore port
stock indices.
Platts daily IOPEX assessments, launched August 1, 2017,
reflect prices of medium-grade iron ore fines port stocks in
Northern China (Caofeidian and Jingtang) and Eastern China
(Rizhao and Qingdao) in Yuan/wmt. Platts IOPEX coverage
also includes brand assessments of Pilbara Blend Fines and
Newman Fines.
Platts additionally publishes the IOPEX 62% Fe import parity
price (IPP) for both regions in dollars per dry metric ton, after
accounting for port charges, VAT and the prevailing exchange
rate, allowing for more convenient comparisons to be made with
prices of seaborne cargoes.
The Chinese portside market complements the seaborne
market in the global iron ore supply chain. Spot trading of iron
ore stockpiles at the respective ports captures shorter domestic
delivery times and smaller lot sizes.
As part of its commitment to open and transparent pricing and
product specifications, Platts is seeking feedback on its IOPEX
assessments and methodology at a time of changing conditions in
the portside market with growth observed in trading activity and
number of participants. Platts invites comment from all market
participants and stakeholders on IOPEX specifications including
regions and locations, grades, brands and normalization factors.
The full IOPEX specifications can be found here: https://www.
