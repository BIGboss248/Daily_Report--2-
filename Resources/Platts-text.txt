Asian iron ore prices rise on
property market stimulus in China
 Traded levels high amid strong demand outlook
 Domestic concentrate prices inch higher
 Lump premiums stabilize
Seaborne iron ore prices were pushed higher Jan. 6, as optimism
from the latest supportive property market policies in China
provided price support to the iron ore market, according to
market sources.
Platts assessed the 62% Fe Iron Ore Index at $119.8/dry mt
CFR North China on Jan. 6, up $2.6/dmt from Jan. 5.
Trading activity on the seaborne market remained largely
unchanged from the previous day, with a handful of trades
concluded over both the primary and secondary market, and as
prices were kept firm on the former.
A deal for an 80,000 mt cargo of Jimblebar Fines (JMBF) was
also reported on Jan. 6, to have been sold by BHP, via bilateral
negotiations, in the later hours of Jan. 5 at a discount of $4.65/dmt
over the February average of the 62% Fe iron ore indexes basis

6 with a Jan. 21-30 loading laycan. “This could be a strong sign
of China lifting the unofficial ban imposed on coal imports from
Australia in 2020,” the source said.
A bid was heard at $300/mt FOB Australia for 35,000-mt
globalCOAL HCCLV Peak Downs with a Feb. 11-20 loading laycan.
Tradeable values were in the $315-$320/mt range for Australia
premium mid-vol Goonyella.
“Now it all boils down to who knows China better and has
a bigger risk appetite, but it definitely was not an end-user
or Indian trader. It has to be China-driven,” an international
trader said.
Seaborne met coal market entered 2023 on a strong note with
prices up 6.5% at $313.75/mt from December, according to S&P
Global Commodity Insights data. “Now the next question is when
this China-driven rally will end, because on one hand, domestic
PLV [premium low-vol] levels are still way above imported level,
but on the other hand, steelmaking activities are falling ahead of
the Lunar New Year,” a Beijing-based trader said.
Seaborne met coke offers remained sparse in the Indian
market amid bearish demand, according to sources. “Met coal
prices are unsustainable and now it is a make-or-buy situation,”
an India-based trader said.
Some end-users were awaiting a price correction in Chinese
blast furnace coke. “Indians are unlikely to pay more than $420/
mt CFR levels for Indonesian coke [65 CSR] as it is a relatively
new commodity in the market,” an Indian coke producer said.
Portside prices at China’s Jingtang port were slightly down on
the possibility of China lifting its unofficial ban on Australian coal
imports and declining restocking demand ahead of the Lunar
New Year.
Platts assessed premium low-vol ex-stock Jingtang down Yuan
50/mt at 2,600/mt Jan. 6, equating to $330/mt CFR Jingtang, and
low-vol hard coking coal ex-stock Jingtang down Yuan 50/mt at
Yuan 2,350/mt, equating to $298/mt CFR Jingtang.

US met coal tracks Australia price
surge on tight seasonal supply
 US prices rise further, tracking Australian FOB pricing
 China import pricing less attractive for US exporters
 Prompt February derivatives slip
Atlantic met coal pricing continued to climb Jan. 6 with tradable
values for US exports gaining support as a lower-priced
alternative to Australian coking and pulverized coal injection
materials.
US miners and suppliers may be depending on operating and
shipping rates keeping up after the holiday lull to meet contracts
and forward sales into met and thermal markets. They may not
have optionality on volumes to look to place spot business for
prompt loadings, especially to fill full vessels and larger partcargo requirements.
Some small clips such as 10,000-30,000 mt may see some
spot trade to fill vessels, to meet January’s busy loading program
off the US East Coast, a source said, with no details on confirmed
trade or offers to securebusiness.
Workable offer indications for spot high-vol hard coking coal
cargo was heard in a range of $290-$310/mt FOB US East Coast
terminals, depending on quality, with index-linked terms for any
spot sales around parity or with premiums to Platts US export
coking coal indices.
The Platts US East Coast low-volatile HCC benchmark
assessment rose $6 to $294/mt FOB Hampton Roads. Platts US
low-vol HCC is based on 58% CSR, 19.25% volatile matter, 8.25%
ash, and 0.95% sulfur.
Platts assessed the US low-vol HCC index as $19.75/mt
below the Australian Premium Low Vol index of Jan. 6, based on
FOB terms.
The Platts US High Vol A index rose $10 to $296/mt FOB USEC
based on 32.25% volatile matter, 1.05% reflectance (MMR), 220%
dilatation, 7.5% ash, 0.95% sulfur, 30,000 ddpm, and CSR typically
in the low 60s.
The Platts US High Vol B benchmark rose $6 to $288/mt
FOB US East Coast based on 36% VM unblended product with
0.95% MMR, 160% dilatation, 8% ash, 1% sulfur, and 25,000 ddpm
fluidity.
US high-vol A and B spreads widened further, as higher
CSR, low ash and lower sulfur high-vol A coals priced closer to
Premium HCC references, and buoyed by a near $10/mt increase
on-day for Australian coking coal and PCI prices. Current spot
availability in high-vol A and B may not allow offers to move
further down in relative pricing terms, with no firm offers or bids
to test trade ranges.
Derivatives continued to support indicative offers with
contracts typically linked to indices and mark-to-market pricing
translating into firm fixed prices.
US met coal business linked to Premium Low Vol index was
pricing higher, with no need or interest seen to sell US coal into
China at lower pricing terms than may be available into other
markets, according to suppliers. Current US FOB index offers
would be higher than netbacks from Chinese import prices.
China import prices remained relatively steady, with no
signs of any new demand to book further volumes of US coals
as Australian coking coals are anticipated to join inaugural
Australian thermal coal imports booked this month. This follows a
more than two-year unofficial coal trade ban between China and
Australia.
With Australian FOB coking coal prices also higher than
netbacks available from China import prices, any trade to China
may be slower to resume, or focus on second-tier Australian coals
or symbolic deals, unless price dynamics shift further.
Blue Creek No. 7 and No. 4 prices were assessed higher than
East Coast indices, while softening relative to the surge in PLV
FOB Australia to $313.75/mt FOB, and forward curve values.
No spot trade or demand for the coals were heard after sales
reportedly made for China in December at lower prices.

The assessed US coking coal brand prices are higher than
netbacks from China imports to the US, while spot demand in
the Atlantic region is weak. Any alternative markets to China
for Blue Creek No. 7 coal will evaluate prices on a delivered
basis, and US freight rates to Asia are usually higher compared
with shipping Australian and Canadian cargoes. Blue Creek No.
4 is rarely seen being offered in the spot market in the past
few years.
Coking coal derivatives were mixed on the day after strong
price gains in the first few sessions of 2023.
February fell 0.56% on the day to $312.25/mt FOB, while
second-quarter 2023 increased 0.09% to $289.25/mt FOB,
according to Platts assessments at the close in Singapore.
Spreads between spot PLV and the Premium HCC forward
strip calculated at the midloading window moved back closer to
parity, as physical prices surged.

Scrap market
US ferrous scrap negotiations
stalled over obsolete grades
 Mills seek to limit secondary grade hike
to $30/lt, while sellers want up $40/lt
 Prime scrap trading underway with
agreements for a $50-$60/lt increase
US ferrous scrap prices were steady in the Midwest Jan. 6
as buyers and sellers were unable to reach settlements on
obsolete-grade prices for January deliveries, although trading
was well underway for prime grades.
Some steelmakers bid and agreed to a $60/lt increase in
prime scrap prices over December prices, while others took a
$50/lt increase, largely depending on availability and volume
requirements.
Platts assessed No. 1 busheling scrap prices in the Midwest
unchanged Jan. 6 at $430-$440/lt on a delivered basis, reflecting
a $50/lt month-on-month price hike pending further confirmation
of price agreements.
But negotiations were more fraught in the Midwest over
obsolete-grade prices for January deliveries and talks will need
to continue the week of Jan. 9 for most buyers and sellers. Minimills in the region were insisting on paying no more than their
initial bids for a $30/lt increase over December prices, while
dealers were insisting on a minimum $40/lt upward increment
due to the slowdown in collections amid severe winter weather
than has hampered supply.
The Platts TSI US shredded scrap delivered Midwest index
remained at $415/lt Jan. 6, after rising the previous day by $30/
lt to reflect steelmaker bid levels but could increase further as
trade agreements are completed.
A Midwest scrap dealer said shredded scrap prices in the
Chicago-area could even see a starker price hike of $50/lt
amid a local shortage of available volumes, but that was likely
to be an outlier compared to other price settlements in the
Midwest.
Meanwhile, ferrous scrap price negotiations in the South
had yet to really get underway and buyers and sellers there
awaited further price signals from their counterparts in the
Midwest.
Southern mills have widely bid for January-delivered prime
scrap at a $50/lt increase over December, and for obsolete
grades at a $30/lt increase, but those expectations would be
subject to similar supply and demand dynamics as the Midwest,
a scrap dealer said.

Turkish deepsea scrap price uptrend
slows as frenzied buying pauses
 HMS 1./2 (80:20) prices remain strong
 US, EU offers in market at higher level
 Turkish buyers pause purchases
Turkish deepsea imported scrap market became quieter and
prices stabilized at higher levels following the flurry of new trades
and price surge earlier in the week.
More February shipments deals were anticipated, with price
direction to be determined in the coming days.
Platts assessed Turkish imports of premium heavy melting
scrap 1/2 (80:20) at $420/mt CFR Jan. 6, up $2/mt day on day.
Scrap suppliers have been successful in getting Turkish
buyers to accept some $18-$20/mt hikes in their heavy melting
scrap 1/2 (80:20) purchases so far this month.
A new offer from a US supplier was heard at $425/mt FOB for
HMS 1/2 (80:20), a Turkish mill source said. A trader put target
prices from EU and US scrap recyclers at respectively $420/mt
and $425/mt CFR Turkey.
The last confirmed US trade was concluded Jan. 5 at $426/mt
CFR Iskenderun for HMS 1/2 (90:10), which indicated $423/mt CFR
for HMS 1/2 (80:20).

Earlier in the week, a US cargo sold at $417/mt CFR Izmir for
15,000 mt HMS 1/2 (80:20), also including 15,000 mt shred at
$437/mt CFR, an agent said.
Another US offer was reported by an agent source at $432/
mt CFR Turkey for HMS 1/2 (90:10), which converted to $429/
mt CFR. The agent said that US suppliers would like to try to
achieve $430/mt CFR in the Turkish market. He believed there
was still upward potential because some Turkish mills were yet
to purchase February shipment. He added that the distribution
of the deals reported in the week to Jan. 6 was not spread evenly
between buyers, as one mill dominated the recent purchasing
activity.
The prices for US HMS 1/2 (80:20) increased from $417/mt CFR
Izmir in a deal closed around Jan. 3, to $423/mt CFR (based on
the HMS 1/2 (90/10) deal at $426/mt) Jan. 5.
An EU scrap merchant expected more Turkish deals for
February shipment to come. He believed that after multiple
cargoes booked between Jan. 3-5, Turkish buyers paused for the
market to cool after the rapid price increase.
“They don’t wait to go to $440-$450/mt CFR,” the recycler said.
Turkish mills are also trying to consolidate the price increase
in the rebar sales before accepting the higher cost of scrap, the
recycler said.
In the shortsea market, a Romanian 25,000 mt cargo was
reported to have been sold at $400-$405/mt CFR Turkey, a scrap
seller said. He also claimed to have received a bid at $400/mt
CFR Turkey and was assuming that $405/mt CFR was achievable.
“I think the market will go up at least a little bit more,” the
source added.

Pig iron
Brazil’s export pig iron set to climb on higher offers
 Sellers targeting $500/mt FOB level for March
 Low supply supporting offers
Higher export offer prices began to test 2023 waters for the
Brazilian merchant pig iron in the week to Jan. 6 as scrap prices
strengthened in the US and material unavailability pushed
delivery times further.
The Platts weekly Brazilian basic pig iron export price
rose 3.4% on Jan. 6 to $460/mt FOB, based on the most
repeatable range of offers, bids and indicative tradable values at
$450-$470/mt.
“We are all waiting for the US scrap market [determination]
– hoping it’s bullish – for January. And let the [Brazilian] rainy
season slow down,” a pig iron producer said.
The sell-side is expecting to achieve the $500/mt FOB level
in March.
Others were already refusing negotiations at below the target
level: “We could be selling at $460-$465/mt FOB to the US, but
we are looking to go higher,” a producer said.
A deal for merchant pig iron to the US was reported during the
week at $470/mt FOB, for about 30,000 mt. Shipment data was
not disclosed.
Another supplier said trade is indeed paralyzed, “But firm talks
may resume in the coming week.”
However, reduced supply remains a challenge: “[There is]
material availability only for shipment in March,” said another
producer.
Another market participant reported similar context: “I believe
that [unavailability] has been the main cause of the rise in
prices both for pig iron in Brazil (huge increase in costs, mainly
in charcoal and freight) and for American scrap, with difficulty in
collecting.”
Platts is part of S&P Global Commodity Insights.
US pig iron import prices rise
with higher offers from Brazil
 Brazilian offers to US mills set to increase to $510-$515/mt
 Rising January US ferrous scrap prices provide support
US pig iron import prices rose modestly in the week to Jan. 6 as
producers returned to the market with intentions to escalate
offer levels to US buyers, but declining freight rates in the Atlantic
provided some counterbalance.
The weekly Platts US pig iron import price was assessed
at $500/mt CIF New Orleans Jan. 6, up $5/mt from the
previous week.
After two trades were completed in the week before the new
year at the $490-$495/mt level, a Brazilian producer said they
would attempt to make their next offers for March shipments at
$510-$515/mt CIF New Orleans.
Rising domestic ferrous scrap prices in the US would provide
support for higher pig iron input costs, while even heavier-thannormal normal seasonal rains in southern Brazil have hampered
production and increased feedstock iron ore and charcoal costs,
the producer said.
Some US steelmakers bid for January-delivered domestic
prime scrap cargoes at a $60/lt increase over December prices,
which was likely to result in settlements around the $430-$450/lt
range on a delivered Midwest basis.
But even as pig iron offers increase on an FOB Brazil basis,
declining Supramax freight rates to around $25/mt this week for
shipments on the Brazil to US Gulf Coast route could provide
some relief to US buyers on a CIF New Orleans basis.
December US pig iron import volumes were the third-largest
monthly total of 2022 and the biggest for Brazilian imports,
according to Panjiva, the trade analysis unit of S&P Global Market
Intelligence. The US received 467,200 mt of pig iron in December,
including 406,800 mt from Brazil.

Freight
Capesize market sluggish as
supply outweighs demand
 Pacific rates capped by tonnage availability
 Atlantic rates not spurred despite pocket of demand
Capesize freight rates experienced persistent weakness Jan. 6
even though there were discussions heard in both basins.
“[It felt like the] market held steady [towards the] end
of the week with some [market participants] hoping for a
pickup in activity pre–Lunar New Year holidays,” said a ship
operator source.
However, the available supply of tonnage continued to build
up in most loading areas which could therefore cap gains in the
short term, the source added.
“[The market was] feeling quiet again today, not much
happening in the Pacific with the miners not seeming [to be] that
active today,” said a shipbroker source.
“While the [forward freight agreement] rates closed slightly
higher, it seems that the physical market [is still] pretty weak
and it doesn’t look like there is turnaround in the short term,” a
second shipbroker said.
“The market seems flat today, haven’t heard much fresh
activity so far,” added a third shipbroker source.
Rio Tinto was heard to have fixed a Capesize ship to move
170,000 mt (plus/minus 10%) of iron ore from Port Dampier in
Western Australia to China at $7.10/wmt for Jan. 22-24 laycan.

170,000 mt (plus/minus 10%) of iron ore from Port Hedland in
Western Australia to China for Jan. 22-24 laycan.
Platts assessed the freight rate for a Capesize ship to move
170,000 mt (plus/minus 10%) of iron ore from Port Hedland to
Qingdao at $7.15/wmt Jan. 6, down 5 cents/wmt from Jan. 5.
Sources said that there were pockets of demand within the
Atlantic basin with a few cargoes heard in the market.
“[I think we] saw [some] fresh cargo for [the] ballasting
tonnage [and] some South Atlantic cargoes [still] remain to be
covered,” said the first shipbroker source.
A shipowner source said that there seemed to be a bit more
demand stemming from Brazil and West Africa and opined that
the first trading week of the year probably saw discussions ensue.
But the source added that the pre-Christmas frenzy which
saw rates spiraling up to what was probably unsustainable levels
could have explained the downward adjustment observed on
almost all Atlantic loading routes since the turn of the new year.
This view was shared by a second shipowner source who
noted that there appeared to be a bit more Atlantic cargoes but
felt the last done rates if any were ‘positional’ citing a tighter end
January tonnage list versus a better supplied one for February
loading dates.
Out of Brazil, Classic was heard to be seeking a Capesize ship
to move 180,000 mt (plus/minus 10%) of iron ore from Itaguai to
Qingdao for Feb. 6 laycan.
Out of West Africa, Swissmarine was heard to be seeking a
Capesize ship to move 170,000 mt (plus/minus 10%) of iron ore
from Nouadhibou to Qingdao for Jan. 19-28 laycan. Indicative
ideas were heard to be $19.25/wmt.
Platts assessed the freight rate for a Capesize ship to move
170,000 mt (plus/ minus 10%) of iron ore from Tubarao in Brazil to
Qingdao at $18.25/wmt Jan. 6, unchanged from Jan. 5.
Activity out of South Africa was heard to be limited though
there was talk of an end January fixture going at the low-$14/wmt
level on the Saldanha Bay to Qingdao iron ore route, but details
could not be confirmed.
Platts assessed the freight rate for a Capesize ship to move
170,000 mt (plus/ minus 10%) of iron ore from Saldanha Bay to
Qingdao at $14/wmt Jan. 6, up 50 cents/wmt from Jan. 5.

Asian iron ore prices rise on property
market stimulus in China ...from page 1
was last traded at a discount of $5.3/dmt and $5/dmt instead over
the same quotational month on Dec. 29 and Jan. 4, respectively.
The front-month February 62% Fe derivatives rose by 2.04%
day on day, from $115.35/dmt on Jan. 5 to $117.7/dmt on Jan. 6,
alongside a day-on-day rise in the Chinese domestic billet and
rebar prices as well.
Following news on China easing up on their “Three Red
Lines” policy, varying views were floating in the market. Some
participants have taken this move as another positive signal in
terms of iron ore demand outlook. “Overall market sentiments
are high and seems likely to be sustained, especially given
the absence of anything else dampening so far,” a Chinese
source said.
Meanwhile, other participants continue to lean on harboring
more careful optimism. “The property market news is supportive
and good for the market, but it still depends on whether or not
downstream steel demand actually picks up, especially since
mill margins are still poor and the cost of raw materials high,” a
Chinese end-user said.
Domestic concentrate buyers and sellers were in a stalemate
status. Traders who held positive views of domestic concentrate
prices on tight supply and strong mills’ demand expectations,
paused offering in the market on Jan. 6 while most steel mills
hesitated to purchase at a high price level. “The price is too high
for us to accept, so we stopped purchasing,” a Northern China
mill source said.
Platts assessed the price of 66% Fe domestic concentrate
delivered to mills based in Tangshan at Yuan 1,045/dmt, up Yuan
15/mt week on week.
At the portside, trading activities dropped significantly on
Jan. 6, as most inland and coast steel mills have almost finished
restocking activities before the Lunar New Year holidays. “Not
much buying activities during the day,” a Chinese trader said. “We
are having enough stocks and no need to purchase from portside
as well,” a northern China mill source said.
Portside transaction prices increased on the day in Tangshan
and Shandong, as traders pushed up offer prices, while some
buyers had to accept higher prices and continued to purchase on
a need basis.
Platts assessed 62% Fe IOPEX North China at Yuan 861/wmt
FOT Jan. 6, up Yuan 4/wmt from Jan. 5, or at $116.79/dmt on an
import-parity basis.
Platts assessed 62% Fe IOPEX East China at Yuan 867/wmt
FOT Jan. 6, up Yuan 14/wmt from Jan. 5, or at $117.56/dmt on an
import-parity basis.
Seaborne lump premiums remained stable. Platts assessed
the spot lump premium at 11 cents/dmtu on Jan. 6, flat
from Jan. 5.

adjustments and additional brand spread.
At 4:28 pm Singapore time (0828 GMT), Rio Tinto sold a
170,000 mt of PBF basis 62% Fe at $119.25/dmt CFR China, on
globalORE, loading Feb. 2-11, from Dampier to Qingdao.
Taking into account impurity adjustments, timing and the
additional brand spread for PBF of minus 30 cents/dmt, the PBF
trade normalized to $120/dmt on IODEX specifications.
The trade was not supported by the tradeable values widely
surveyed with the market participants.
Platts used a backwardated structure of 75 cents/dmt
between January and February.
Exclusions: No market data was excluded from the
assessment process on Jan. 6.

globalCOAL HCCLV Peak Downs with a Feb. 11-20 loading laycan.
This was for coal normalized to parity with Platts PLV FOB
Australia at $300/mt.
Tradeable values were in the $315-$320/mt range for
Australian premium medium volatile matter Goonyella,
normalized to a $2.50/mt premium to Platts PLV FOB Australia at

Platts EMEA Turkish Ferrous Scrap Daily Rationale
Platts assessed Turkish imports of premium heavy melting scrap
1/2 (80:20) at $420/mt CFR Jan. 6, up $2/mt from Jan. 5.
An agent source confirmed a US trade at $417/mt CFR Izmir
for around 15,000 mt HMS 1/2 (80:20). He added that the deal
was concluded earlier in the week and did not reflect higher
achievable prices more recently. The cargo also included
15,000 mt shred at $437/mt CFR. The agent source put buyer
tradable values at $425/mt CFR Turkey for HMS 1/2 (90:10), which
converted to $422/mt CFR for HMS 1/2 (80:20). He added a
tradable value for HMS 1/2 (80:20) should be around $424-$425/
mt CFR, US-origin. The agent also reported an offer at $432/
mt CFR for US HMS 1/2 (90:10), which indicated $429/mt CFR for
HMS 1/2 (80:20). He also reported a US offer for HMS 1/2 (80:20)
at $425/mt CFR Turkey. A Turkish mill source was also familiar
with the US offer at $425/mt CFR.
A UK-origin offer for prompt shipment was reported by a
market player at $420/mt CFR Turkey.
A trader in Turkey indicated buyer tradable values at maximum
$420/mt CFR Turkey for premium HMS 1/2 (80:20).
A mill source reported tradable values between $417-$423/
mt CFR for premium HMS 1/2 (80:20). Another Turkish mill source
said that offers were in the $420s/mt CFR Turkey for premium
HMS 1/2 (80:20). A European recycler reported an offer for EUorigin HMS 1/2 (80:20) at $420/mt CFR Turkey. Another European
recycler said that the sellers’ target prices for EU and US HMS 1/2
(80:20) were between $420-$425/mt CFR Turkey.

US Shredded Scrap Midwest Daily Rationale
The daily Platts TSI US Midwest shredded scrap index was
assessed at $415/lt on a delivered basis Jan. 6, unchanged from
the previous day.
A scrap dealer selling to mini-mills in the Midwest said
negotiations were at an impasse over shredded scrap prices for
January deliveries, with mills bidding for a $30/lt increase from
December price levels while dealers were pushing for up $40/lt.
A dealer in the Midwest said Chicago-area shredded scrap prices
there could be up $50/lt month on month, due to a localized
shortage amid severe winter weather. However, that area was
likely an outlier compared to the rest of the region.

The above rationale applies to the daily Platts TSI shredded
scrap delivered US Midwest index with the associated market
data code: FEMWD00

Platts opens consultation on IOPEX
domestic Chinese iron ore port stock indices
Platts, part of S&P Global Commodity Insights, is opening a
consultation to invite feedback on the assessment methodology
and specifications for its IOPEX domestic Chinese iron ore port
stock indices.
Platts daily IOPEX assessments, launched August 1, 2017,
reflect prices of medium-grade iron ore fines port stocks in
Northern China (Caofeidian and Jingtang) and Eastern China
(Rizhao and Qingdao) in Yuan/wmt. Platts IOPEX coverage
also includes brand assessments of Pilbara Blend Fines and
Newman Fines.
Platts additionally publishes the IOPEX 62% Fe import parity
price (IPP) for both regions in dollars per dry metric ton, after
accounting for port charges, VAT and the prevailing exchange
rate, allowing for more convenient comparisons to be made with
prices of seaborne cargoes.
The Chinese portside market complements the seaborne
market in the global iron ore supply chain. Spot trading of iron
ore stockpiles at the respective ports captures shorter domestic
delivery times and smaller lot sizes.
As part of its commitment to open and transparent pricing
and product specifications, Platts is seeking feedback on its
IOPEX assessments and methodology at a time of changing
conditions in the portside market with growth observed in trading
activity and number of participants. Platts invites comment from

Platts extends feedback period for proposal
to introduce MOC timing, increments guidelines
for PLV FOB Australia metallurgical coal
Platts, part of S&P Global Commodity Insights, is extending
the feedback period for its proposal to introduce timing and
increment guidelines for its premium low vol (PLV) FOB Australia
metallurgical coal Market on Close assessment process, to Jan.
23, 2023. The proposed implementation date is now Feb. 24, 2023.
Platts initially proposed the timing and increments
guidelines on Dec. 9, available here https://www.spglobal.
com/commodityinsights/en/our-methodology/subscribernotes/120922-platts-proposes-to-introduce-moc-timingincrements-guidelines-for-plv-fob-australia-metallurgical-coal.
Following initial market feedback, Platts now also proposes to
update the volume specification stated in the above guidelines,
to “in accordance with the latest Global Metallurgical Coal
Specifications Guide” from “minimum cargo size of 10,000 mt.”
The proposed guidelines aim to bring greater clarity and
transparency to the assessment process amid increased market
interest in submitting firm, transparent data for consideration
in the PLV FOB Australia price assessment. Fully verifiable,
transparent information that includes the identities of buyers and
sellers, in addition to price, volume, location and stated trading
terms, is ranked highest in Platts hierarchy of data and given the
greatest priority when determining a final market assessment.
Platts MOC guidelines are a key component of its assessment
methodology, essential to an orderly and transparent publishing
process. For PLV FOB Australia, Platts would publish named bids,
offers and interest to trade from approved participants in the
MOC process in line with the following proposed guidelines:
Timing and increments
To ensure sufficient time for all market information to be
tested, buyers and sellers must submit any bids and offers with
complete information to Platts editors by phone, instant message
or email before 1700 Singapore time or 0900 GMT.
Only bids and offers that are raised or lowered in reasonable
increments are considered for the assessment. Counterparties
can improve the price of their published bids and offers every
five minutes, by a minimum increment of $1/mt and a maximum
increment of $2/mt. No price changes are allowed in the final five
minutes of the MOC process that concludes at 1730 Singapore
time or 0930 GMT. Buyers and sellers may withdraw their bids or
offers at any time during the MOC by communicating the same
to Platts editors. Counterparties must clearly communicate their
interest to trade a published bid or offer to Platts editors.
Platts may notify the market of any adjustment to
incrementability in the event of market volatility or a
disruptive event.

Specifications, GT&Cs
Transparent bids, offers and interest to trade would be
published in line with Platts existing specifications for PLV FOB
Australia:
Volume: In accordance with the latest Global Metallurgical
Coal Specifications Guide.
Basis port: Hay Point, Australia
Quality: Premium low vol hard coking coal. Premium mid vol
bids and offers may be considered for publication subject to
normalization to PLV.
Platts full metallurgical coal assessment specifications are
available here: https://www.spglobal.com/commodityinsights/
PlattsContent/_assets/_files/en/our-methodology/
methodology-specifications/global_metcoal.pdf.
GT&Cs: Counterparties are expected to perform on trades
reported in the MOC based on typical GT&Cs and credit terms
that have been applied and accepted by both counterparties in
the open market. If an offer is lifted by a buyer during the Platts
MOC process, Platts would expect typical GT&Cs and credit
terms between both parties to be applicable, even where the
GT&Cs and credit terms stated in the originally published offer
may differ, if the companies have not conventionally performed
on the published terms.
Platts applies objective criteria to review entities that wish
to participate in the transparent MOC process and monitors
all MOC participants to ensure that input data provided by
these entities reflect typical market trading practices and
standards. For more information on the counterparty review
process, please visit https://www.platts.com/market-on-close.
Entities that wish to participate in the MOC should contact
pricegroup@spglobal.com.
Please send your feedback on the proposed timing and
increment guidelines by Jan. 23 to PL_CokingCoal@spglobal.com
and pricegroup@spglobal.com.
For written comments, please provide a clear indication if
comments are not intended for publication by Platts for public
viewing. Platts will consider all comments received and will make
comments not marked as confidential available upon request.
Platts proposes change to volume specification of APAC,
Europe seaborne metallurgical coal assessments
Platts, part of S&P Global Commodity Insights, is proposing
to update the volume specification for its APAC and Europe
seaborne metallurgical coal assessments and calculations, to
minimum 30,000 mt from minimum 10,000 mt, effective Feb.
24, 2023.
The proposed changes aim to better reflect the typical
cargo size of spot transactions observed by Platts over the past
24 months.
Under this proposal, Platts may normalize price information
for cargoes smaller than 30,000 mt to that of a standard
Panamax volume (70,000-85,000 mt) using prevailing
differentials.

Platts to revise NWE Ferrochrome Low-Carbon coverage to
assess 60%-64.99% chrome and premium 65%-70% Cr content
Following market feedback, Platts, part of S&P Global Commodity
Insights, is to launch a weekly DDP NWE Ferrochrome LowCarbon 0.10% carbon, 60%-64.99% chrome assessment, and will
amend the existing weekly DDP NWE Ferrochrome Low-Carbon
0.10% Carbon assessment to reflect 65%-70% chrome content,
from 60%-70% currently, effective Feb. 1, 2023.
Platts will also revise volume specifications for the amended
low-carbon ferrochrome 65%-70% Cr DDP NWE assessment
and move the assessment publication to a single close value,
discontinuing associated high and low price points, with effect
from Feb. 1.
The changes were first proposed Nov. 4, 2022 in a subscriber
note available here:
https://www.spglobal.com/commodityinsights/en/ourmethodology/subscriber-notes/110422-platts-proposes-torevise-nwe-ferrochrome-low-carbon-coverage-to-assess-60-

The decision to implement the proposed changes was
communicated in a subscriber note published Nov. 21*:
https://www.spglobal.com/commodityinsights/en/ourmethodology/subscriber-notes/112122-platts-to-revise-nweferrochrome-low-carbon-coverage-to-assess-60-6499-chromeand-premium-65-70-cr-content
Platts has observed a clear pricing distinction between lowcarbon ferrochrome with 60%-64.99% chrome content, sourced
typically from China and India, and the premium low-carbon
ferrochrome with 65%-70% chrome content, sourced typically
from Europe and Central Asian origins.
Platts has also observed an increase in market activity for
low-carbon ferrochrome with 60%-64.99% chrome content
DDP NWE in recent months as the Chinese domestic stainless
steel market weakened, widening the discount from premium
ferrochrome with a higher chrome content.
Under the changes, the existing low-carbon ferrochrome
assessment, under the symbol code MMAIL00, will be
amended to reflect 65%-70% Cr content, normalized to 67% Cr
content basis.
Platts will also revise the quantity, dimension and product
specifications as follows:

Platts proposes to revise Global Molybdenum
Oxide Daily Dealer assessment specifications
Platts, part of S&P Global Commodity Insights, is proposing to
update the specifications for its Global Molybdenum Oxide Daily
Dealer assessment, effective Feb. 20.
The proposal follows an open consultation, with feedback
invited in a subscriber note published Dec. 2.
Following initial market feedback, Platts is proposing the
following specification changes:
 Incoterms: Refining incoterms prioritized for the assessment
to in-warehouse (IW) and cost, insurance, and freight (CIF),
normalizing market information heard on a delivered or
delivered duty unpaid (DDU) basis to IW.
 Locations: Narrowing Europe location specifications from
European ports to Rotterdam, narrowing South Korea location
specifications from South Korean ports to Busan.
 India duties: Normalizing indications reported on a CIF Nhava
Sheva/Mumbai basis to duty-free material.
 Product specifications: Reflecting material in 1mt bags, from
drummed material currently.
 Payment terms: Introducing a cash-against-documents
payment term specification, with scope for other payment
terms to be normalized to cash against documents.
Under this proposal, the incoterm and location bases
reflected in the assessment would be as follows:
 In-warehouse Rotterdam
 In bonded warehouse Tianjin
 In-warehouse Busan
 In-warehouse US
 CIF India
 CIF Japan
The proposed changes would serve to better reflect trading
activity and would allow for more granular normalization of
premium markets.
Platts is additionally proposing to apply a 4:30 pm London
time stamp to all daily assessments, ending the current practice
of early market close at 1 pm London time on the last working day
of the calendar month.
The assessment would continue to take into account all
information reported to Platts in the 24-hour period up to 4:30
pm London time each day.
